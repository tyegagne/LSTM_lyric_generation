My hand goes with your chest
Steady now, moon will pull
A slow and even breath
Outa the blue, the storm rolls in
I see it in your eyes
Thunder strikes, but I will be
A place for you to hide
Your heart rises and it falls just like the waves
The highest point is just before it breaks
I will light a candle for you welcoming
Baby, come home to me
Night moves in
And you can't see, a star up in the sky
Let my voice anchor you
I promise the sun will rise
Your heart rises and it falls just like the waves
The highest point is just before it breaks
I will light a candle for you welcoming
Baby, come home to me
I am standing, on the shore
I am holding a light
I am standing, on the shore
I am holding a light
I am standing, on the shore
I am holding a light
I am standing, on the shore
I am holding
You're heart rises and it falls
Just before it breaks
I will light a candle
Your heart rises and it falls just like the waves
The highest point is just before it breaks
I will light a candle for you welcoming

Your heart rises and it falls just like the waves
The highest point is just before it breaks

And wild seas lie still, deep and blue
Though life has sent me troubles, I'll feel no pain
If I never spend a morning without you
If I never spend a morning without you
When hope was an ocean-pounding heart
Then love was the ship that carried me through
And now I've reached my Island I'll find peace again
If I never spend a morning without you
If I never spend a morning without you
Old the land, older its people. But the promise of new life is still
the victor o'er decay. Hold the dream, pass by the stranger,
He can never call this land his home
Nor wish the truth away.
With the honesty of fire light on your face
We while away the hours as lovers do
At the closing of the evening I will ask no more
If I never spend a morning without you
If I never spend a morning without you
Old the land, older its people. But the promise of new life is still
the victor o'er decay. Hold the dream, pass by the stranger,
He can never call this land his home
Nor wish the truth away.
Though tomorrow is still no more than dreams
It's yesterday that gives me strength to do
For the hardest roads will run like silk to me,
it seems.
If I never spend a morning without you
If I never spend a morning without you"

As fair art thou, my bonie lass,
So deep in luve am I;
And I will luve thee still, my dear,
Till a' the seas gang dry.
Till a' the seas gang dry, my dear,

"5" "When I was a miller in Fife,
Losh! I thought that the sound o' the happer
Said, ``Tak' hame a wee flow to your wife,
To help to mak' brose to your supper.''
Then my conscience was narrow and pure,
But someway by random it rackit;
For I lifted twa neivefu' or mair,
While the happer said, ``Tak' it, man tak' it.''
Then hey for the mill and the kiln,
The garland and gear for my cogie,
And hey for the whisky and gill,
That washes the dust frae my craigie.
Although it's been lang in repute
For rogues to mak' rich by deceiving,
Yet I see that it disna weel suit
Honest men to begin to the thieving.
For my heart it gaed dunt upon dunt,
Oh, I thought ilka dunt it wad crack it;
Sae I flang frae my neive what was in't,
Still the happer said, ``Tak' it, man, tak' it.''
A man that's been bred to the plough,
Might be deav'd wi' its clamorous clapper;
Yet there's few but would suffer the sough,
After kenning what's said by the happer.
I whiles thought it scoff'd me to scorn,
Saying, ``Shame, is your conscience no chackit?''
But when I grew dry from a horn,
It chang'd aye to ``Tak' it, man, tak' it.''
The smugglers whiles cam' wi' their pocks,
'Cause they kent that I likit a bicker,
Sae I bartered whiles wi' the gowks,
Gied them grain for a sowp o' their liquor.
I had lang been accustomed to drink,
And aye when I purposed to quat it,
That thing wi' its clappertie clink
Said aye to me, ``Tak' it, man, tak' it.''
But the warst thing I did in my life,
Nae doot but ye'll think I was wrang o't;
Od! I tauld a bit bodie in Fife
A' my tale, and he made a bit sang o't.
I have aye had a voice a' my days,
But for singin' I ne'er gat the knack o't;
Yet I try whyles, just thinking to please
The greedy, wi' ``Tak' it, man, tak' it.''
Now, miller and a' as I am,
This far I can see through the matter;
There's men mair notorious to fame,
Mair greedy than me o' the muter.
For 'twad seem that the hale race o' men,
Or, wi' safety, the hauf we may mak' it,
Ha'e some speaking happer within,
That said to them ``Tak' it, man, tak' it.''"
"6" "Ah me, I must mourn my true love evermore
Though coldly forsaken, it's you adore
And if you'd return then I'd make you my bride
Or I'd cross the wild Atlantic to be by your side
On the morning we parted, how sad the farewell
Our words, they were few, but our thoughts none could tell
And when lost to my vision far over the brine
I drank your success in a goblet of wine
Three times have I crossed to the ship as she lay
Becalmed on the breast of the silvery bay
And my crew are the bravest ever handled an oar
And not by the tempest, they laugh at its roar
No ballroom can tempt me nor raise my dispair
For there none in the dance that with you can compare
And to watch the young lovers as they swing 'round the floor
Brings tears to these eyes that may see you no more
And in beauty there's none with this lady could buy
She's as pure as the stars and the blue of the sky
She's as fair as a lily and as sweet as a rose
And there's nothing can tempt me, her name to disclose
No drink will I take for to lighten my heart
But the wildest adventures I'll take for my part
No women on earth will I have for a bride
'Til I cross the wild Atlantic to be your side
Ah me, I must mourn my true love evermore
Though coldly forsaken, it's you adore
And if you'd return then I'd make you my bride
Or I'll cross the wild Atlantic to be by your side"

And draw your chairs to mine.
And I'll tell you of my country,
That you might understand.
And of the English armies,
That marched in for to stay.
Oh that night they wounded Old Ireland,
And she's bleeding to this day.
Their dogs of war were loosed to run
And hunt the rebels down
They hoped to rule this land by fear
And hold it for the Crown
But a mighty thought was born in Men
When they killed James Connolly
Oh that night they wounded Old Ireland
And she's bleeding to this day.
The Border lies like an open wound
That only love can heal
For bitterness and cruelty
They will never close the weal
The mean of vision built a dream
Which the blind men stole away
Ah that night they wounded old Ireland
And she's bleeding to this day.
My heart it holds a vision clear
That thousands more can see
Of Ireland free from hatred
And death and bigotry
Where Irishman to Irishman
Can in friends clasp a hand
If we banish fright from the Ulster night
Then we'll free Old Ireland."

Why roam your lane amang the heather?\"

Do take my advice;
To Americay I'd have youse not be farin'

Where the murdering cannons roar,

I sold me horse and plough,
Me little pigs and cow,
And me little farm of land and I parted.
And me sweetheart, Biddy McGhee,

For I left her there that morning, broken hearted.

Meself, and a hundred more,
To America sailed o'er,
Our fortune to be making, we was thinking;
But when we landed in Yankee land,
They shoved a gun into our hand,
Saying,\" Paddy, you must go and fight for Lincoln. \"

That ever we came to Cromdale\"
\"We were in bed, sir, every man
When the English host upon us came
A bloody battle then began
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale\"
\"The English horse, they were so rude
They bathed their hoofs in Highland blood
But our brave clans, they boldly stood
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale\"
\"But, alas, we could no longer stay
For over the hills we came away
And sore we do lament the day
That ever we came to Cromdale\"
Thus the great Montrose did say
\"Can you direct the nearest way?
For I will over the hills this day
And view the Haughs of Cromdale\"
\"Alas, niy, Lord, you're not so strong
You scarcely have two thousand men
And there's twenty-thousand on the plane
Stand rank and file on Cromdale\"
Thus the great Montrose did say
\"I say, direct the nearest way
For I will over the hills this day
And see the Haughs of Cromdale\"
They were at dinner, every man
When the great Montrose upon them came
A second battle then began

Oh, then they fought most valiantly

M'Lauchlins fought like loyal souls

So boldly as they took the field
And made their enemies to yield
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale
The Gordons boldly did advance
The Frasers fought with sword and lance
The Grahams they made the heads to dance
Upon the Haughs of Cromdale
The loyal Stewarts with Montrose
So boldly set upon their foes
And brought them down with Highland blows

Five hundred fled to Aberdeen

"24" "In the year '98, when our troubles were great
It was treason to be a Milesian.
And the black-whiskers said we would never forget
And our history shows they were Hessians.
And in these troubled times, it was a great crime
And martyrdom never was riper
Near the town of Glenshee, not an acre from Meath,
Lived one Denny Burns, the Piper!
Neither weddin' nor wake would be worth a shake
If Denny was first not invited.
For at squeezin' the bag, or emptyin' the keg,
He astonished as well as delighted!
But in these times Denny could not earn a penny,
Martial Law had him stung like a viper!
And it kept him within till the bones of his skin
Grinned thru the rags of the piper!
Now one day it did dawn, as Denny crept home,
Back from a fair at Lethangin,
When what should he see, from the branch of a tree,
But the corpse of a Hessian, there hangin'!
Says Denny, \"These rogues have got boots, I've no brogues!\"
He took hold of the boots wi' a griper,
And the boots were so tight, and he pulled with such might,
Legs and all come away with the piper!
Ah, then Denny did run for fear of bein' hung
Til he came to Tim Haley's cabin.
Says Tim from within, \"I can't let ye in!
Ye'll be shot if you're caught out there rappin'!\"
So he went to the shed where the cow was in bed,
He began with a whisp for to wipe her,
And they lay down together, in seven foot of heather,
And the cow took to huggin' the piper!
Well the day it wore on, and Denny did yawn,
And he stripped off the boots from the Hessian!
And the legs, be the law, he just left in the straw,
And he slipped home with his new possessions!
Now breakfast bein' done, Tim sent his young son
To get Denny up like a lamplighter,
And the legs there he saw; he flew up like a jackdaw!
And said \"Daddy, the cow's et the piper!\"
Ah, bad luck to that beast, she's no musical taste!
To eat such a jolly old chanter!
A Phairaig a mhic, Take a lump of a stick!
Drive her off, down the road and we'll canter!
Well the neighbors were called, Mrs. Kennedy bawled,
She began for to humbug and jiper,
And in sorrow they met, and their whistles they wet,
And like devils, lamented the piper!

Denny The Piper (Cont.)
And the cow she was drove a mile or two off,
And they came to a fair at Killaley.
And there she was sold for four guineas of gold
To the clerk of the parish, John Daly.
And they went to the tent where the pennies were spent,
Tim bein' a jolly old swiper,
And who should be there, playin' the Rakes of Killdare,
Just your bold Denny Burns, the piper!
Ah, then Tim give a jolt like a half-drunken colt,
And he stares at the piper like a gamog,
I thought, by the Powers, for the last sev'ral hours,
You were playin' in the old cow's stomach!
Well when Denny observed that the Hessian's been served
Began just to humbug and jiper,
Oh, in grandeur they met, and their whistles they wet,
And like devils they danced round the piper!"
"25" "The moon's on the lake, and the mist's on the brae,
And the Clan has a name that is nameless by day;
Our signal for fight, that from monarchs we drew,
Must be heard but by night in our vengeful haloo!
Then haloo, haloo, haloo,Grigalach!
If they rob us of name, and pursue us with beagles,
Give their roofs to the flame, and their flesh to the eagles!
Then gather, gather, gather, Grigalach!
Gather, gather, gather, Grigalach!
While there's leaves in the forest, and foam on the river,
MacGregor, despite them, shall flourish for ever!
Glen Orchy's proud mountains, Coalchuirn and her towers,
Glenstrae and Glenlyon no longer are ours;
We're landless, landless, landless, Grigalach!
Landless, landless, landless, Grigalach!
Through the depths of Loch Katrine the steed shall career,
O'er the peak of Ben-Lomond the galley shall steer,
And the rocks of Craig-Royston like icicles melt,
Ere our wrongs be forgot, or our vengeance unfelt!
Then haloo, haloo, Grigalach!
If they rob us of name, and pursue us with beagles,
Give their roofs to the flame, and their flesh to the eagles!
Then gather, gather, gather, Grigalach!
Gather, gather, gather, Grigalach!.
While there's leaves in the forest, and foam on the river,
MacGregor, despite them, shall flourish for ever!
Then gather, gather, gather, Grigalach!
Gather, gather, gather, Grigalach!
Gather, gather, gather, &c.;
Gather, gather, gather, Grigalach!"

"27" "Pity the fate of a poor Irish stranger,
That wanders so far from his home,
That sighs for protection from want, woe, and danger,
That knows not from which way for to roam.
Yet I'll never return to Hibernia's green bowers,
For tyranny tramples the sweetest of flowers,
That once gave me comfort in loneliest hours
Now they are gone I shall ne'er see them more.
With wonder I gazed on yon lofty building,
As in grandeur I rose from its lord,
But soon I beheld my fair garden yielding
The choicest of fruit for his foe.
But, where is my father's lone cottage of clay,
Wherein I' ve spent many a long day,
Alas ! has his lordship conniv'd it away ?
Yes, it is gone, I shall never see it more.
When nature was seen in the sloe bush and bramble,
All smiling in beautiful bloom,
Over the fields without danger, I often
Did ramble amidst their perfume ;
I have wranged through the woods where the gay feather'd
throng
Joyfully sung their loud echoing song
These days then of summer passed sweetly along,
Now they're goneI shall ne'er see them more !
When the sloe and the berries hung ripe on the bushes
I have gathered them off without harm
I have gone to the field and shorn the green rushes,
Preparing for winter's cold storm !
Along with my friends telling tales of delight,
Beguiling the hours of the long winter's night,
Those days gave me pleasureI could them invite ;
Now they're gone, I shall ne'er see them more."

"29" "Oh, there're sober men in plenty,
And drunkards barely twenty,
There are men of over ninety
That have never yet kissed a girl.
But gie me a ramblin' rover,
And fae Orkney down to Dover.
We will roam the country over
And together we'll face the world.
There's many that feign enjoyment
From merciless employment,
Their ambition was this deployment
From the minute they left the school.
And they save and scrape and ponder
While the rest go out and squander,
See the world and rove and wander
And are happier as a rule.
I've roamed through all the nations
Ta'en delight in all creation,
And I've tried a wee sensation
Where the company, did prove kind.
And when partin' was no pleasure,
I've drunk another measure
To the good friends that were treasure
For they always are in our minds.
If you're bent wi' arth-i-ritis,
Your bowels have got colitis,
You've gallopin' with bollockitis
And you're thinkin' it's time you died,
If you been a man of action,
Though you're lying there in traction,
You will get some satisfaction
Thinkin', \"Jesus, at least I tried.\""
"30" "There was a fair young lady so lately I've been told
She lived with her uncle, the cause of all her woes;
Her uncle had a ploughboy, which Mollie liked quite well
And in her uncle's garden their tender love did tell.
So early one morning this old man he arose
And at Mollie's room door he hastened on his clothes,
Saying, \" Arise you handsome female, and married you shall be
For the squire is a-waiting on the banks of sweet Dundee.
\"A fig to all your squires, to lord and Jews likewise,
For William 'pears like diamonds a-glittering in my eyes.\"
\"You never shall have Willie, nor happy shall you be
For I mean to banish Willie from the banks of sweet Dundee.\"
The first crowd came on Willie when he was all alone,
He fought full hard for his liberty, but there were eight to one;
\"Pray kill me now,\" says Willie, \"Pray kill me now,\" says he
\"For I'd rather die for Mollie on the banks of sweet Dundee.\"
As Mollie was walking, lamenting for her love
She meets the wealthy squire, all in her uncle's grove.
\"Stand off, stand off!\" says Mollie, \"Stand off, you man,\" says she,
\"For I'd rather die for Willie on the banks of sweet Dundee.\"
He threw his arms around her and crushed her to the ground,
There she spied two pistols and a sword beneath his morning-gown;
The pistols she slipped slyly, and the sword she used free
She shot and killed the squire on the banks of sweet Dundee.
Her uncle overheard them, come hastening to the grove
Saying, \"You've killed the wealthy squire, prepare for your death-blow,\"
\"Stand off, stand off!\" says Mollie, \"Stand off, you man, says she,\"
So the trigger drew and her uncle slew on the banks of sweet Dundee.
The doctor being sent for, he knew that they were killed
Also there came a lawyer to write the old man's will.
He willed his gold to Mollie, because she fought so free
Then closed his eyes to write no more on the banks of sweet Dundee"
"31" "THERE came to the beach a poor exile of Erin.
The dew on his thin robe was heavy and chill;
For his country he sighed, when at twilight reparing.
To wander alone by the wind-beaten hill.
But the day-star attracted his eyes' sad devotion,
For it rose o'er his own native isle of the ocean,
When once in the fire of his youthful emotion,
He sang the loud anthem of Erin-go-Bragh.
\"Sad is my fate!\" said the heart-broken stranger :
The wild-deer and wolf to a convert can flee.
But I have no refuge from famine and danger-
A home and a country remain not to me.
Never again, in the green sunny bowers,
Where my forefathers lived, shall I spend the sweet hours,
Or cover my harp with the wild-women flower,
And strike to the numbers of Erin-go-Bragh.
\"Erin, my country ! though sad and forsaken,
In dreams I revisit thy sea beaten shore:
But alas ! in a far foreign land I awaken,
And sigh for the friends who can meet me no more
O! cruel fate ! wilt thou never replace me
In a mansion of peace where no perils can chase me?
Never again shall my brothers embrace me.
They died to defend me, or live to deplore.
\"Where is my cabin door, fast by the wild wood?
Sisters and sire, did you weep for its fall?
Where is the mother that looked on my childhood?
And where is the bosom friend dearer than all?
O! my sad heart! long abandoned by pleasure,
Why did it dote on fast-fading treasure?
Tears, like the rain-drops, may fall with-out measure,
But rapture and beauty they cannot recall."
"32" "It being a fine morning, this young man he chose
That he'd make occasion to wear his fine clothes
And it's down to the glen where the bonnie lassie goes
To give her a token of his love, we suppose
\"Mary, oh Mary, if I could be your man
Between you and danger I fearlessly would stand
With this gold claddagh ring on your lily-white hand
Oh, there ne'er was another would dress you so grand.\"
There's no sun in summer there's no flowers in spring
Her hands hold my heart like the gold claddagh ring.
\"Johnny, oh Johnny the ring it is of gold
And it's hands and fine heart, they are lovely to behold
But if I had the ring for one evening to hold
Then you shall have my answer e'er the week shall be old.\"
\"Oh why have the weeks gone and not an answer came ?
And why is it that women are smarter than men ?
Oh the girl's kept the ring which I shall ne'er see again
Oh, she has many like it in a fine box at hame.\"
There's no sun in summer there's no flowers in spring
Her hands hold my heart like the gold claddagh ring.
It being a fine morning, this young man he chose

"33" "My darling, do not break your heart
Though I leave this Irish shore
Though their cruel laws may force us to part
Fate may join we two once more
Take this farewell kiss as a token
Of my love while far I stray
For true love will never be broken
Let me kiss your tears away
Like the rain, like the rain
When he turned his back to Donegal
Her tears fell like the rain
Don't let your eyes fill with sorrow, love
Don't wet your pretty cheeks with tears
There will come a bright new tomorrow, love
There will come an end to fears
Dark may seem our lives December
Time will bring to us the May
Love will guide me back remember
Let me kiss your tears away
Like the rain, like the rain
When he turned his back to Donegal
Her tears fell like the rain
Take this jewelled ring to wear, my love
While I am o'er the wave
Next my heart you know I will wear, my love
This lock of hair you gave
Kiss me once before we sever
For my safety say, you'll pray
You will be my dearest, forever, love
Let me kiss your tears away
Like the rain, just falling like the rain
When he turned his back to Donegal
Her tears fell like the rain
Like the rain, like the rain
When he turned his back to Donegal
His tears fell like the rain"

"35" "I am a wand'ring minstrel man,
And Love my only theme,
I've stray'd beside the pleasant Bann,
And eke the Shannon's stream;
I've pip'd and play'd to wife and maid
By Barrow, Suir, and Nore,
But never met a maiden yet
Like Brighidin Ban Mo Store.
My girl hath ringlets rich and rare,
By Nature's fingers wove -
Loch-Carra's swan is not so fair
As her breast of love;
And when she moves, in Sunday sheen,
Beyond our cottage door,
I'd scorn the high-born Saxon queen
For Brighidin Ban Mo Store.
It is not that thy smile is sweet,
And soft thy voice of song -
It is not that thou fleest to meet
My comings lone and long;
But that doth rest beneath thy breast,
A heart of purest core,
Whose pulse is known to me alone,
My Brighidin Ban Mo Store!"
"36" "I mourn for the Highlands, now drear and forsaken
The lands of my fathers the gallant and brave
To make room for the sportsmen, their lands were all taken
And they had to seek out new homes far away
Oh shame on the tyrants who brought desolation
Who banished the brave and put sheep in their place
Where once smiled the gardens rank weeds in their station
And deer are preferred to the leal-hearted braves
Oh where are the parents and bairns yonder rovin
The scene o' their gladness is far o'er the main
No blithe-hearted milk-maid now cheers at the gloaming
The herd-boy no longer seen on the plain
But the lark is still soaring; she sings in her glory
With no one to listen her sweet morning lay
The clansmen are gone, but their deeds live in story
Like chaff in the wind, they were borne far away"
"37" "Ae fond kiss, and then we sever,
Ae fareweel, alas, for ever!
Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee,
Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee.
Who shall say that Fortune grieves him,
While the star of hope she leaves him?
Me, nae cheerful twinkle lights me;
Dark despair around benights me.
I'll ne'er blame my partial fancy,
Naething could resist my Nancy,
But to see her was to love her,
Love but her, and love for ever.
Had we never lov'd sae kindly,
Had we never lov'd sae blindly,
Never met-or never parted,
We had ne'er been broken-hearted.
Fare-thee-weel, thou first and fairest!
Fare-thee-weel, thou best and dearest!
Thine be ilka joy and treasure,
Peace, Enjoyment, Love and Pleasure!
Ae fond kiss, and then we sever!
Ae fareweeli alas, for ever!
Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee,
Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee."

Singing no sad songs
When the hard times come around

Leaving her was never easy

The face in my mirror is the one face I know
You have taken all that's in me, so my heart is in no danger
My heart is in no danger, but I'd still like to know
If there is a silence then it can be broken
If there beats a pure heart to her I will go
And time will work its healing and the spirit will grow stronger

He turn'd him right and round about,
Upon the Irish shore,
And gae his bridle reins a shake,
With adieu for evermore, my dear,
And adiue for evermore.
The soger frae the wars returns,
The sailor frae the main;
But I hae parted frae my Love,
Never to meet again, my dear,
Never to meet again.
When day is gane, and night is come,
And a' folk bound to sleep,
I think on him that's far awa,
The lee-lang night, and weep, my dear,
The lee-lang night, and weep."
"50" "Oh, what a parish, a terrible parish;
Oh, what a parish is that o' Dunkeld.
They hangit their minister, droon'd their precentor,
Dang doun the steeple and fuddled the bell.
The steeple was doun but the kirk was still staunin',
They biggit a lum whaur the bell used to hang.
A stell-pat they gat and they brewed Hielan' whisky;
On Sundays they drank it and ranted and sang.
O, had you but seen how graceful it lookit,
To see the crammed pews sae socially joined.
MacDonald the piper stood up in the poopit,
He made the pipes skirl out the music divine.
Wi' whiskey and beer they'd curse and they'd swear;
They'd argue and fecht what ye daurna weel tell.
Bout Geordie and Charlie they bothered fu' rarely
Wi' whisky they're worse than the devil himsel'.
When the hairt-cheerin' spirit had mounted their garret,
Tae a ball on the green they a' did adjourn.
The maids wi' coats kilted, they skippit and liltit,
When tired they shook hands and then hame did return.
If the kirks a' owre Scotland held like social meetin's
Nae warnin' ye'd need from a far-tinklin' bell,
For true love and friends wad draw ye thegither
Far better than roarin' the horrors o' hell."
"51" "There was a lord, lived in this town
Who had a handsome, lovely daughter.
She was courted by a fair young man
Who was a servant to her father.
But when her parents they came to know
They swore theyd send him from the island.
The maid she knew her heart would break
Had she to part with young Matt Hyland.
Then straightway unto her love she goes,
Into his room him to awaken.
Saying, arise my love, and go away,
This very night you will be taken.
I overheard my parents say
In spite of me he will transport you.
So arise, my love, and go away,
I wish to God Id gone before you.
Oh must I go, to her he said,
Oh must I go without my wages.
Without one penny allin my purse
Just like some poor, forlorn stranger
Heres fifty guineas all in bright gold
And thats far more than father owes you.
So take it now and go away,
I wish to God Id gone before you.
They both sat down upon the bed
Just for the side of one half hour,
Not a word did either speak,
But down their cheeks the tears did shower.
She rests her head upon his breast
And round his neck her arms entwined.
Not duke nor lord, nor earl Ill wed
Ill wait for thee my own Matt Hyland.
Ill wait for thee my own Matt Hyland.
Ill wait for thee my own Matt Hyland."
"52" "My name is Patrick Sheehan, and my years are thirty-four;
Tipperary is my native place, not far from Galtymore;
I came of honest parents, but now they're lying low;
Though' many's the pleasant days we spent in the Glen of Aherlow.
My father died; I closed his eyes, outside the cabin door;
For the landlord and the sheriff too, were there the day before,
And then my lovin' mother, and my sisters three, also,
Were forced to go with broken hearts, from the Glen of Aherlow
For three long months, in search of work, I wandered far and near;
I then went to the poorhouse to see my mother dear;
The news I heard near broke my heart, but still in all my woe,
I blessed the friends who made their graves in the Glen of Aherlow.
Bereft of home and kith and kin, with plenty all around,
I starved within my cabin, and slept upon the ground;
But cruel as my lot was, I never did hardship know,
Till I joined the English army, far away from Aherlow.
\"Rouse up there,\" cried the corporal, \"Ya lazy Irish hound!
Why don't you hear the bugle, its call to arms to sound? \"
I found I had been dreaming of the days long, long ago,
And I woke upon Sebastopol, and not in Aherlow
I tried to find my musket, how dark I thought the night!
O blessed God! It wasn't dark, it was the broad daylight!
And when I found that I was blind, my tears began to flow,
And I longed for even a pauper's grave in the Glen of Aherlow.
A poor neglected mendicant, I wander Dublin's streets
My nine months' pension it being out, I beg from all I meet;
As I joined my country's tyrants, my face I can never show,
Amongst my dear old neighbors in the Glen of Aherlow.
So Irish youths, dear countrymen, take heed in what I say;
For if you join the English ranks, you'll surely rue the day
And whenever you're tempted, a-soldiering to go.
Remember poor blind Sheehan from the Glen of Aherlow."
"53" "Let your quacks and newspapers be cutting their capers
About curing the vapors the scratch and the gout
With their medical potions, their serums and their lotions
Upholding their notions, they're mighty put out.
Who can tell the true physic to all that's pathetic
And pitch to the divil, cramp, colic and spleen
You'll know it I think if you take a big drink
With your mouth to the brink of a jug of poteen
So stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
Oh what botheration, no dose in the nation
Can give consolation like poteen me boys.
No liquid cosmetic to lovers athletic
Or bodies pathetic can give such a bloom
As the sweet by the powers in the garden of flowers
Ever gave their own bowers such a darling perfume
And this liquid so rare if you willingly share
To be taking your hair when it's frizzled and dead
Oh the sod has the merit to yield the true spirit
So strong it will shake all the hairs from your head
Then stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
Oh since its perfection, no doctor's direction
Can cleanse the complexion like poteen me boys
While a child in me cradle, me nurse with her ladle
Was filling my mouth with a notion of pap
When a drop from her bottle fell into my throttle
I stumbled and capered clean out of her lap
On the floor I lay crawlin' and screaming and bawling
'Til me mother and father were called to the fore
All sobbing and sighing they feared I was dying
But soon found I only was crying for more.
So stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
Oh lord how they'd chuckle if babes in their truckle
They only could suckle on poteen me boys
Through my youthful aggression, through times of depression
My childhood's impression still clung to my mind
And at school or at college the basis of knowledge
I never could gulp 'til with whiskey combined
And as older I'm growing times ever bestowin'
On Erin's potation, a flavor so fine
And how ere they may lecture on jove and his nectar
Itself is the only true liquid divine
So stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
Oh lord, 'tis the right thing for courting and fighting
There's nowt so exciting as poteen me boys.
Come guess me this riddle, what beats pipes and fiddle
What's hotter than mustard and milder than cream
What best wets your whistle, what's clearer than crystal
What's sweeter than honey and stronger than steam
What'll make the lame walk, what will make the dumb talk,
The elixir of life and philospher's stone
And what helped Mr. Brunnell to build the Thames Tunnel
Wasn't it poteen from ould Inisowen
So stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
Oh lord, it's no wonder, if lightning and thunder
Weren't made from the plunder of poteen me boys.
You maidens pathetic, with lovers athletic
For liquid cosmetic, you can't beat the drop
With a glow to your cheek, it will make your heart leap
It'll quiet a stallion or cure an old cob
At the mouth you would drool, be reduced to a fool
You'd kick up your heels and you'd peel to the buff
Then 'tis he'd be pathetic while you'd be athletic
If only you'd take a few drops of the stuff
So stick to the cratur' the best thing in nature
For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys
For there's nothing like whiskey to make maidens frisky
It soon separates all the men from the boys."

"56" "Black bay whered you go
I have lost any light from your boats
And it only makes me feel more alone
Grey fog dont you tire
Of the dark isolation of night
I know that the pressure gives you life
I know that the truth comes with the quiet
But Im just so afraid of mine
So I blame the ones that I love
When I am no one to act as a judge
I know the bottles not best
But Im just so starved for some kind of rest
From these lungs
And my tied tongue
What makes a man cave
To the simple escape from his days
Is it only a triumph over fear
Of what happens when waking disapears
Or do we secretly love these tears"
"57" "No answers
No absolutes
All theories
With no kind of proof
Clinging on to what we were told
In our youth
I know what they believe I just dont
Know why now
With all that weve learned
Still no answers
With no stone unturned
I know Im never gonna be right
And so I
Im filling my belly tonight"
"58" "I read the advice in your letter
To see myself without a filter
So tonight I have locked all my doors
And Im down on all fours
Wild again
The dawnlight is slowly approaching
Eyes open to slow down the spinning
I bet youd be proud of me now
Lost in my own house
I cant find a way out
I used to believe
That shame only came on display
To the others
But I was wrong
Im here by myself and the feeling is strong
Im learning to split into portions
The pain that comes sharp with the morning
I take some with coffee and then
I bring some back to bed
And wait for a dream"
"59" "You shouldnt trust me
I cant decide
Whether my instincts
Care what is right
If good is inherent
Its hard to find
Beneath the conceit
In our design
They say were the only
Capable of charity
But I would be lying
To make a claim
Of any decisions
That arent in vain
When even my giving
Could be explained
By the willful feelings
That overtake me"
"60" "In the dark of night
When the last drop of blind youth
Has left you
You will wake to find
That you have been lied to
You're nothing more
Than cells, same as the ones that surround you
And the will to make
And build what there isn't
Before you
Now will break
This paper and concrete
Are nothing new
Just earth moved and glued, stuck to you
I warned you
There's no use
Trying to win"
"61" "Shivering
I am looking in at
People that I call my friends
Just a sillhouette
With a cigarette
And no idea who I am
There were songs in these eyes
But now theyre gone
If only I had held the light in
Flashing teeth
They are smiling
So happy to burn through their time
And I dont know when
But I lost the will to savor mine
Now theyre all
Stumbling to some other house
Though Ive tried I cant find any interest now
It takes
The guilt of just a small mistake
To puncture the joy
So its poisoned by doubt
I just wanted to face the expanse
But those dead ends have come to haunt me
I had tried to understand
How I should operate this body
And I was sure, but I was wrong
If only I had held the light in
The darkness would be gone"
"62" "A knock on my door
Woke me this morning
Made by the hand
Of a well-dressed woman
Whod set aside
Part of her morning
To ask me if I know why Im alive
She walked by a man
Who scours the alley
Each day for cans
To trade for money
To buy a chance
To play the lottery
And when he doesnt win, he starts the cycle again
Made to scavenge
Like an animal
So I cannot help
But watch him searchin
For lucky breaks
Just like a vulture
And wonder if
His sense of purpose is any less than what Im gettin here
Bettered by wealth
and education
But just as unsettled
and impatient
I am too easily sustained
I cant sleep
If I am made to obey
Then why this brain
This plague of intellect that infects
Any peaceful state
Cause I cant say
If anything
Is meaningful
Or some impulse to trick me into
Another day
Of this grey"
"63" "Feed me make yourself proud
Fill my mouth up until I drown
You pull me onto dry land
And choke me out with the same two hands
We die and never come back
And each of us has to learn from scratch
So Im left to follow my gut
But who in the fuck can I trust when my own blood
Lies to me
Leads my mouth to drink
And then punishes me in the morning
I have no
Kind of hold
To pull myself from cold grief
That fills my heart with warning
So I fight but I cant stop the bite of these teeth
Dont you flatter yourself
We give or we take but were only selfish
Just blinking counting our days
Watching the shadows upon this cave"
"64" "We were sitting at a table at a little caf
Cleaning our plates like some kind of a race
We finished our meal without making a sound
I glanced at him, he flagged the waitress down
She brought us our check and said will that be all
He said, yeah thanks, and sent her off with a nod
I'm sure she was thinking, I don't know about those guys
But when she counted her tip, she had to smile
What I got from him is my stubborn side
and the tapping my fingers on the wheel when I drive
And the gift of keeping strangers an arms length away
Not knowing what I'm thinking behind my poker face
When I'm stuck in a crowd at a party somewhere
With people that I'm supposed to know
I don't do small talk, but I'll shake your hand
You'll wonder about me, and I'll consider us friends
What I got from him is my quiet side
And annoying everybody with how slow I can drive
And the habit of never calling anybody by name
So they're never quite sure if I know who they are
As they try to read my poker face
If you see us out at some little caf,
cleaning our plates like some kind of a race
And you can't figure out if we're happy or mad
That's the way that we like it, me and my dad
I tend to be a little bit cheap,
but I tip pretty well and I'm easy to please
And I like keeping strangers an arms length away
And I like keeping secrets behind my poker face"
"65" "Tonight in Carolina, the bleachers are empty and quiet
Not a ball's been hit my way all night
I hit a grounder up the middle, but the shortstop made the play
I'll never make it to the big leagues this way
But the smell of fresh cut grass and peanut shells fill the southern sky
And we'll be heading back to Birmingham tonight
CHORUS;
These towns roll by like tumbleweeds
Through the windows of these late-night trains
To those of us down here, it's still a game
I may never be a hero, and you'll never know my name
But if I broke the record, I would do it clean
Last week out in Greenville, about an hour before the game
A boy was watching warm-ups, with a big smile on his face
He put down his popcorn, held out a ball and pen
He looked a little awestruck, as I signed it for him
I didn't ask for money, I just smiled and shook his hand
You should've seen the spring in his step, as he ran to show his dad
`
REPEAT CHORUS
America's favorite pastime, it's simple and it's pure
We all still watch the big leagues, but now we're not so sure
But if you can catch a game in Birmingham, on a perfect summer day
I'll run out every grounder, that's how I learned to play
It's not glamorous in double A, it's not for everyone
But baseball's what I do, who I am and what I love"
"66" "The pocket is torn from the years it's spent catching
The car keys and the spare change
You can tell it's been worn from the tears in the stitching
This old sweatshirt's seen better days
In March '96 I was traveling through this town
And wanted a cheap souvenir
I would never have guessed from the name on the chest
That one day I'd end up living here
12.99, bought me the chance to stay warm for the night
Now in my mind, it takes straight back to that place and that time
It's amazing the things you can buy for 12.99
I can still picture the red in her face
Just as clear as this stain on the sleeve
She was convinced that she'd ruined our first date
When she spilled her coffee on me
But the heat was no match for the look that she had
As the air outside kept getting colder
We drove to the beach, and she shivered beside me
And I draped it over her shoulders
12.99, bought her the chance to stay warm for the night
Now in my mind, it takes me straight back to that place and that time
It's amazing the things you can buy for 12.99
It's just 13 bucks, at the courthouse downtown
For the papers to make her my bride
I dig through the pocket, and come up one coin short
The judge says that he'll let it slide
It's amazing the things you can buy
12.99, bought me the chance to look back on my life
One day in my mind, I will remember this place and this time
It's amazing the things you can buy for 12.99"

She's an angel in flight
In a blink of an eye
She'll be out of your sight

Well I swear that I heard
From a lost mockingbird stuck up in a tree

It's in a dusty dresser drawer now
I watched these trees from green to brown
Suddenly this small town has gotten smaller
The arctic breeze it sings to me, and says now look
Any fool can go out and walk on water
I shoulda known that time alone
Would only serve to break you down
Don't know why I sit and stare at that damn thing sitting there
In a dusty dresser drawer now
Snow has turned to water
To please the trees
And cheer up that late bloomer
While I'm sipping on a beer counting down another year
Couldn't come a second sooner
I wonder how easily that ring it slid off of your finger
Did you stop for a moment
Let the memory of us linger
Or was it just an afterthought
Like casting water from a bow
I'm past the point of crying
For a love that lies there dying
In a dusty dresser drawer now
It's such a goddamn shame
Right next to your picture frame

If anybody asks me what I think, that love is for now, I'll tell them

Well the morning came like a freight train, bearing down on me from a
Thousand miles a way.
Well it came and gone and kept rolling on, laying up all night with tear
Stained sheet as my veil.
Chorus:
I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to see you again, I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to feel your breath
As you leaned on me so peacefully while we slept
And I donÃ¢ÂÂt want the keys to our door, I donÃ¢ÂÂt live there anymore
And IÃ¢ÂÂll do my best just to forget the dreams weÃ¢ÂÂve dreamt
Verse 2:
Well the morning came with the pouring rain, and I felt just as empty as a
Pail.
With the evidence and your crime confessed, it donÃ¢ÂÂt seem right that itÃ¢ÂÂs
Me that spent nights in jail.
Chorus:
I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to see you again, I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to feel your breath
As you leaned on me so peacefully while we slept
And I donÃ¢ÂÂt want the keys to our door, cause I donÃ¢ÂÂt live there anymore
And IÃ¢ÂÂll do my best just to forget the dreams IÃ¢ÂÂve dreamt
Bridge:
If you feel a chill in the air, itÃ¢ÂÂs my spirit hanging somewhere
And if you ever get scared, look on the bright side
YouÃ¢ÂÂve got a new life
Verse 3:
Now the evening's come, and IÃ¢ÂÂm all alone
And I canÃ¢ÂÂt tell if silence is my foe or my friend
Well IÃ¢ÂÂm holding on, but I ainÃ¢ÂÂt too strong
IÃ¢ÂÂve gotta get some rest before that train come back around the bend
Chorus:
I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to see you again, I donÃ¢ÂÂt want to feel your breath
As you leaned on me so peacefully while we slept
And I donÃ¢ÂÂt want the keys to our door, I donÃ¢ÂÂt live there anymore
And IÃ¢ÂÂll do my best just to forget the dreams weÃ¢ÂÂve dreamtÃ¢ÂÂ¦.dreams weÃ¢ÂÂve

"89" "Well I walked over the bridge
Into the city where I live
And I saw my old landlord
Well we both said, \"Hello\"
There was no where else to go
'Cause his rent I couldnt afford
Well relationships change
Though I think its kind of strange
How money makes a man grow
Ah, some people they claim
If you get enough fame
You live over the rainbow, over the rainbow
But the people on the street
Out on buses or on feet
We all got the same blood flow
Oh in society every dollar got a deed
We all need a place that we can go
And feel over the rainbow
Sometimes we forget what we got
Who we are or who we are not
I think we got a chance to make it right
Keep it loose, keep it tight, keep it tight
Im in love with a girl whos in love with the world
Though I cant help but follow
Though I know someday she is bound to go away
And stay over the rainbow
Got to learn how to let her go over the rainbow
But sometimes we forget who we got
Who they are or who they are not
There is so much more in love than black and white
Keep it loose child, you gotta keep tight
Keep it loose, keep it tight, keep it tight
Keep it tight, yeah"

Often time it's just as blue

That's just what I'm gonna do
Now everybody want to treat me like a house fly
Turn me around and tell me to shoo
They want to tell me to keep on dreaming
That's just what I'm gonna do
Every moral has a story
Every hand needs a glove
Sometime it's for the glory
Ah, but mostly, it's for the love
It's the love
It's the love
It's the love that pulls me through
So when they tell me to keep on dreaming
That's just what I'm gonna do
That's just what I'm gonna do"

In the lies of a lonely friend
And so much superstition
And so much worry in my heart
I need a new religion
Its time to make a brand new start
And the world aint no easier
Than its ever been
Looking for love
In the lies of lonely friend
Remember when we were in California
We were so much happier then
Now were back in New York City
Looking for love in the lies of a lonely friend
And now the clocks are running
And no one knows where time goes
You know the moon is stunning
Its only shadows that she shows
And the world aint no harder
Than its ever been
Looking for love
In the lies of lonely friend
I aint no wide eyed rebel
Oh, but I aint no preachers son"

I know there ain't nothin' out there
I'm still afraid to turn on the lights

Yes I would give it all up for you
Yes I would give it up

We live in a world full of confusion
A culture based in illusion

When they told you they discovered you
And that everything is free
As long as you do what they tell you to
You think it's true

Did you even listen when they told you to change your name
Now nobody wants honesty when looking at a perfect frame
Play the game
But nothing could be further from the truth, my love
And nothing is more powerful than beauty in a wicked world
Play it girl
Play it girl
Play it girl
Does it make you feel good
When they tell you what you want to hear
And after they suck all your soul
Well, that's when they'll disappear
Disappear, disappear for ever
Like a prince in your little fairy tale
And you will find it when they put your soul on sale
But nothing could be further from the truth, my love
And nothing is more powerful than beauty in a wicked world"

Feeling like such a mess
Now I'm down I'm just hanging on the corner
I can't help but reminisce
'Cause when you're gone all the colors fade
When you're gone no New Year' Day parade
You're gone colors seem to fade
Your mama called, she said that you're downstairs crying
Feeling like such a mess
Yeah, I hear ya background bawling
What happened to your sweet summer time dress?
I know we all, all got our faults
We get locked in our voids and make mistakes"

Longing for the warmth of childhood to bring them home again
All my friends, they got broken hearts
And if the world's a stage we're searching for our parts
We'll face the winds that break the strongest of trees
Beckon for the sweet soft summer breeze
All my friends, they got broken wings
Never will you hear them asking why the caged bird sings
'Cause all my friends they know how to live
Oh, so much sorrow and so much love to give
We'll face the winds that break the strongest of trees
Beckon for the sweet soft summer breeze
And oh now we all know that the storm is coming
Everybody wants to know which way to go
I see the crowds a running and oh the wind's gonna blow
All my friends are dear to me
Oh when the storm comes they're as close as family
All my friends are the ones I choose
Oh, if I hear them knockin' you know I can't refuse
We'll face the winds that break the strongest of trees

Dont spend time wasted
Believing a lie

Washing on your shore

A true love's been lost
And I can't get back anymore
And I'm sure
That we both still both love her
And it's a shame we both lost her
And in time lost each other

I don't want your mercy, tonight
I wanna see the devil in your eyes
Are you strong enough to watch me die
Late at night while I lie awake watching you so peacefully
Oh a fantasy of how you're gonna set me free
Cause this brutal truth is too true to deny
And I'm begging you to free the pain that locks me up inside
I want you to hurt me
Break me down
I want you to hurt me
Let the pain lead me out
I don't want your mercy, tonight
I want to feel the devil in your eyes
Are you strong enough to watch me die
I want you to hurt me
Break me down
I want you to hurt me
Let the pain lead me out
I don't want your mercy, tonight
I want to feel the devil in your eyes
Are you strong enough to watch me die"
"120" "Met her on a Tuesday
Went out on a Friday night
Said she was lookin' for a love affair
And I was lookin' for a getaway flight
So we packed up a bag
And hailed up a cab
And I grabbed my guitar because
It was the only thing that I had
Well I learned to travel lightly
Babe, livin' alone
Some say that it's the hard way, mama
But it's all that I've known
And if I move fast enough, hopefully
Oh the darkness can't catch up to me
Hey, Hey, Hey
So we headed off the mainland
With the beating of a drum
She turned and smiled and said, honey
Where you from?
I said I'm from all over
But I was born in the wind
She turned and smiled and said
You're goin' home again
Well I learned to travel lightly
Livin' alone
Some say that it's the hard way, mama
But it's all that I've known
And if I move fast enough, hopefully
Oh the darkness can't catch up to me
Hey, Hey, Hey
Oh I hear that train
A comin' around the bend
Oh in the morning I'll be
Runnin' away again
Runnin' away, runnin' away again
When she woke up in the morning
With the rising sun
In her heart she knew
I'd be gone
But I wrote her a letter
With the words to this song
She read it on the balcony
While the wind was strong
Well I learned to travel lightly
Cause I was born alone
Some say that it's the hard way, mama
But it's all that I've known
And if I move fast enough, hopefully
Oh the darkness won't catch up to me
Hey, Hey, Hey"
"121" "Darlin'
I've been waiting my whole life for you
And I'll be waiting
Till you come back through
You say you always needed
Oh you're sure to find
Someone to ease your worried mind
So just leave this behind
Honey,
You say that you gotta leave now forever
I have no choice but to say goodbye
Till you come back through"
"122" "When you cannot get to sleep at night
Taunted by that new daylight
When you just can't sleep before the morn
And you do not feel reborn
Wait up for me
Wait up for me
I'll be coming home
So you don't have to be alone
When you're lost out in this world
And you feel you've come undone
You ain't nobody's little girl
You ain't nobody's sacred son
Wait up for me
Wait up for me
I'll be coming home
So you don't have to be alone
Well I'm ragged too
Just like you
I might not show it
But I feel it inside
Well I'm ragged too
Lost and blue
Feeling like a little
Child
Lately I've been thinking of
All the losin' that I've done in love
The wind she steals my sweet caress
Please feel me in your emptiness
Wait up for me
Wait up for me
I'll be comin' home
So you don't have to be alone
Wait up for me
Wait up for me
I'll be comin home
So you don't have to be alone"
"123" "Baby in your loving eyes
Baby in your loving hands
Baby I can see right now
It's only you who understands
When there are no cures
My pain becomes yours
Sitting in this twilight
With a half-drawn shade
Don't wanna lose that light
Never wanna see it fade
I don't wanna lose you yet
I wanna see another summer sunset
With you
With you
Baby the sea gonna rise
Then the sea gonna fall
I just hope there's peace
Somewhere beyond this wall
I'm gonna keep you here with me
Wherever you go
Wherever you're gonna be
That's where I'm gonna go
I'll be
With You
With You
Baby in your lovin' eyes
Baby in your lovin' hands"
"124" "Should've let you walk away the first time
Instead of letting you walk back through my door
As if I needed any more pain
Oh I've been waiting up so long
I've been sleeping out so long in the rain
Rain been falling down
I've been stressing all the time
And I can't seem to find
A little piece of mind I guess I'll just vaporize
Everything that's inside
I guess I'll just vaporize
I, I, I
I guess I'll just vaporize
Everything that's inside
I'm gonna get
high, high, high, high, high, high
Now you want to talk about the hard times
And all the joy that you bring
Are you even listening
To the strain
Oh I've been waiting up so long
I've been sleeping out so long in the rain
Rain been pouring down
I've been stressing all the time
I can't seem to find
A little piece of mind
I guess I'll just vaporize
Everything that's inside
I guess I'll just vaporize
I, I, I
I guess I'll just vaporize
Everything that's inside
I'm gonna get
High, high, high, high, high, high
Ain't no use in the truth
When the lies are raw anyway
Ain't no use in the truth, you say
Ain't no use in the truth
When the lies are raw anyway
Ain't no use in the truth, you say
I guess I'll just vaporize
Everything that's inside
I'm gonna just vaporize

I'm gonna just vaporize
Everything that's inside
I'm gonna get
High, high, high, high, high, high"
"125" "Lost child only wants to find a place
where he can fit in and play
Rain cloud hovers all around
his head he's hidden away
Through all this pain
oh I can see these clouds just drifting away
Through all this pain
oh I can see these clouds just drifting away
A black rose grows in the city garden, hidden away
Despite not finding the proper sunlight, she finds a way
Through all this pain
oh I can see these clouds just drifting away
Through all this pain
oh I can see these clouds just drifting away, oh
Lost child hungry for a celebration, sits upon a stone
Left with only his imagination, still a party is thrown
Through all this pain oh I can see these clouds just drifting away
Through all this pain oh I can see there's gonna be a celebration day, oh"
"126" "Walkin' down Royal Street
A street singer symphony
Ain't been the hardest way
Ain't had the greatest day
Walkin past memories
And the pain that she gave to me
Don't you know I'm tryin to be the bigger man
I just wanna feel the spirit
I just wanna feel the spirit
I just wanna feel the spirit
Washin' over me
Me and Madame Laveau
Seen some people come and go
Seen a couple storm clouds pass
Seen a couple spells been cast
People trippin' down cobblestones
Marching bands and trombones
Everybody's out here waitin on the second line
And I'm just fine
I just wanna feel the spirit
I just wanna feel the spirit
I just wanna feel the spirit
Washin' over me
Storm clouds out up ahead
Singin' songs of praise to raise the dead
I got a heart that was born to be
Broken down and wild and free
Johnny came in on a train
With not a dollar to his name
Just an old guitar case
And the bruises on his pretty face
Walkin' down a railroad track
He aint never comin' back
Said mama I don't know if I'm every comin' home again
But until then
I just wanna feel the spirit
I just wanna feel the spirit
I just wanna feel the spirit
Washin over me"
"127" "Softer than the summer sun across my window
Oh she's lying there, as the violets will bloom
Round and round this carousel
I am underneath her spell
She's lying there silently
I'm patiently waiting
Wondering
If I can kiss her on her shoulder
It's just new love
It's just new love
I can smell last night's perfume
Like the sun up in the sky while the moon is still there
All these times to share
I can't wait to say good morning baby
What you wanna do today?
I can't wait to get you home
I'm gonna get you home, yeah
You alleviate my fears and my anxieties
You set my mind at ease, your sensitivities are free
Your sensibilities will see and I can't wait
I say too I can't baby
What you want to do today?
I can't wait to get you home, yeah
I'm gonna get you home, yeah"
"128" "Highways, clouds
Ain't no stopping, it's all I've gotten
As far as I've dropped in, as far as I've come
I'm from the badlands
Raised up by hard hands
You can't feel your face when
The wind makes you numb
Highways and clouds
Highways and clouds
We meet in the middle
With highways and clouds
Based Madonna
Do you wanna
Hop on my Honda
And get on the run
When you're rollin'
You lose all your schoolin'
It's all for fools man
That can't come undone
Highways and clouds
Highways and clouds
We meet in the middle
Highways and clouds
Highways and clouds
Highways and clouds
We'reall lost a little
In highways and clouds
Ain't no roadmap
We lost it at Flagstaff
It's too late to turn back
There's nothing to gain
So swallow me darkness
The cruel and the heartless
Will hold to our harness
And feed from our pain
Highways and clouds
Highways and clouds
We're all lost a little In highways and clouds
Highways and clouds
Highways and clouds
We meet in the middle
Of highways
And clouds"
"129" "I know it ain't been easy I know it ain't been good lately
All I'm askin' for you
Is just to be honest with me
She's writing on my walls
It's over
She's writing on my walls
We're through
She's writing on my walls
She ain't saying
Baby I'm not in love with you
Been a minute since we really connected
Got lost in the shuffle of our busy lives
I understand it happens
But I didn't think it would happen to us baby
She's writing on my walls
It's over
She's writing on my walls
We're through
She's writing on my walls
But she ain't saying
Baby I found someone new
My love's still here
After all these years
And all these tears
All these tears
Oh, after all these tears
Ain't nothing you can keep me away, baby stay
But I'm starting to think things ain't gonna work out
Baby it's okay
All you gotta do is say
The real way you're feeling about me
I'm a man
She's writing on my walls, it's over
She's writing on my walls
We're through
She's writing oh

Baby I'm not in love with you"
"130" "When I look into your clear blue eyes
I could cry, I could cry
When I think of what they've put you through
You know it tears me up inside
Left alone in your darkest night
By the one you trusted most
How come they expect you to
Be such a gracious host?
When you look upon that heart of shame
Now I have to face
All these accusations and questions that
Are aimed at your disgrace
Now you are left in the darkest night
By the ones you trust the most
But now just follow blind ambition
Like a promise of unknown costs
When I look into your clear blue eyes
I could cry, I could cry
When I think of what they put you through
You know it tears me up inside
You know it tears me up inside
You know it tears me up inside"
"131" "All my best days are behind me now
Photographs tell of my wedding vows.
And if you want heroes then I'd sail up to the stars
For all I got beneath my skin are tears and scars.
I walked in these shoes ten thousand miles,
Been through all sorts of bleating trials,
So if you want heroes then I'll tell you where to go
I'll sell you a map to thank the faces that you know
Oh but for now I'll just be at this all night show
Oh yes tonight I'll spend my lonely dollar slow.
Yes I've loved and lost and loved again
Happy ever afters never been
And if you want love than I suggest that you not wait
Cause I will know not what I've waited at heaven's gate
All my best days are behind me now
Still I find a way to live somehow."
"132" "Lately I
I've been heading for a breakdown
Every time I leave my house
Well, it feels just like a shake down
Between street sweepers and the pushers are the lawyers
Who may as well be butchered
Between the small timing hustlers who all
Seem to feed upon each other
Oh, God, why you been
Hanging out in that ol' violin
While I've been waiting for
ou
To pull me through?
Lately I
Every time I try to lie down
While my mind just lets away
I can't even close my eyes now
Between the big fish and ambition and the lovers
Using words as ammunition
Between the wood planks, I've been pacing endless
Impossible dream that I've been chasing
Oh, God, why you been
Hanging out in that ol' violin
While I've been waiting for you
To pull me through?
Oh, God
Oh, God
Oh, God, why you been
Hanging out in that ol' violin
While I've been waiting for you
To pull me through?
Oh, God
Oh, God
Oh, God"

We all do what we got to do
Hey darling, I'm broken hearted
I've been crying but my crying is through
And I've learned a lot
I really learned a lot
Broken down on a bathroom floor
Yes, I've learned a lot
I really learned a lot
I hope you found what you are looking for
Spent a lot of time staring at the ceiling
Spent a lot of time talking to wall
Spent a lot of time chasing that old time feeling
Spent a lot of time waiting on your call
And I've learned a lot
I really learned a lot
Broken down on a bathroom floor
Yes, I've learned a lot
I really learned a lot
I hope you found what you are looking for
Oh and darling, the sun has been falling
Like the dust on some Midwestern plane
Oh and darling, instead of running
I think it might be time you sit down
And deal with the pain
Late at night I sit and listen to the freeway
Rolling like a river on a distant shore
Nobody told me that living was easy
I ain't living in fear anymore
And I've learned a lot
I really learned a lot
Broken down on my bathroom floor
Yes, I've learned a lot
I really learned a lot
I hope you found what you are looking for
Hope you found what you are looking for"

That treated me so well

You know I've been opposed
By a barb-wired fence
And a murder of crows
I'm leaving all I've loved
And all I've seen
Headed down the border road
Called the El Camino
Headed down the border road
Called the El Camino
Yeah, my hearts grown sick
I've got a shepherd's crook
As a walking stick
And I'm headed on
Yeah, my heart's grown blue
I've done wrong by you
I don't know what to do
And I'm moving on
Yeah, I'm moving on
One and one is two
And two and two is four
I'm walking back and forth
On your cracked-tile kitchen floor
With the orange juice
And the sun that shines
It really breaks my heart
Leaving you behind
It really breaks my heart
Leaving you behind
All my ships have sailed away
The price of this politic is
That there's plenty of time to pray
Plenty of time to waste away
Well, to all my friends
That I've loved the most
You know I'm headed out
To that other coast
Gonna wash my soul
Gonna get it clean
Headed down the border road

The world is born
Shoe's untied

This rocky road and this steering wheel
Who do you call to ease your pain?
I hope for you to get through this rain

Moon is hanging low
Windows are rolled down

Is it what you dreamed it'd be?
Are you locked up in this fantasy?

And whenever I'm alone won't you please be near

Oh so wild and free,
Oh so wild and free,

Corrupted and defeated me

Another man down with a flag to fold

And not the same can be said for his brand new bride
Inspired love with no hand to hold

I know it's been a long time coming
You say you've been, out there a long time running

But you lost it somewhere along the way
You used to be so beautiful
But it's easier now to walk away
That wonder wall you're waiting for is now collapsing
Tell me more, but wait no no
Let me find out what you're asking for
You used to be, so beautiful
But you lost it somewhere along the way
You used to be so beautiful
And it's easier now to walk away
Away, away
Now you have everything that you have ever wanted
Oh it's so sad to see
When the hunter becomes the hunted
You used to be, so beautiful

Oh how you watched them heal
No you never turned away
You were never afraid to feel
Oh you stay, stay with me
Oh you stay, stay with me.
Oh and when the morning comes
Just know darling,
I had to be moving on
Oh and when the winter comes
Oh and you can't decide
For your rabbit to run
Or your rabbit to hide

Please stay, stay with me.
Will you stay, stay with me
Will you stay, stay with me
Will you stay,

Used to be so serene

Many days I've got my hands full
Tryin' to find out what's real
But a bunch of hungry eyes will
Turn you into a meal
Beware that smiling face beneath that ole street lamp
He's got those tricksters and hucksters and scamps
He cut a hole in the bucket
Watched that water follow down
Said if I'm gonna be a hero
Gonna have to make a mess out of this town
Well he waited for a while so
Everything would turn to rust
Waited for he slept next to a pistol
Set a price upon my trust
But he stole that election
Put his face on every stamp
On his council were tricksters, hucksters and scamps"

To play along
Well, what's been going on?
What's been going on?
What's been going on
Around here?
There goes her old beat up car
Outside of our old favorite bar
She's probably in there playing her guitar
With stars in her eyes
Those are some of my favorite memories
All those carefree melodies
While I'm out of here on this raging sea
About to capsize

So much superstition and so much worry in my heart
I need a new religion its time to make a brand new start
And the world aint no easier than its ever been
Looking for love in the lies of a lonely friend
Remember when we were in California
We were so much happier then
Now were back in New York City
Looking for love in the lies of a lonely friend
And now the clocks are running
And no one knows where time goes
You know the moon is stunning
Its only shadows that she shows
And the world aint no harder than its every been
Looking got for love in the lies of a lonely friend"

The world was born into a blanket of sin,
When all the faith's been gone,
Still we found a reason to carry on,

Through the worry, worry, worry,
Caught in an endless maze
Oh when the lights go out,
All I can think about,
Is how, we've seen better days
Oh lover lately I've been thinkin' I might leave you,
As you're surrounded by these fools who do deceive you,
Yes our past is wretched true,
But I'm still in love with you,
Thats why I am still refusin' to give in to
[Chorus]
Where do we go from here,
While we're all so consumed by fear,
Why I'm trying not to be suspicious of those I'm suspicious of,
I'm tryin' to crack-open this angry heart and find a little love,

Oh when the lights go out,
All I can dream about,
Is how, we've seen better days"
"148" "Been kicked around so long you're starting to get used to how it feels
The taste of blood that's in your mouth that still somehow it always heals
Don't know how you keep on getting up from all those ghostly blows
And all that pain that lingers deep down in the darkness where it grows
I know how hard it is to keep your head up kid
To keep your head up kid
And there you sit on high all tucked away and locked up in the clouds
Waiting for someone to finally come along and take you out
Into this bitter world that also often treated you so cruel
When they turn away you know that they will say that you're a fool
I know how hard it is to keep your head up kid
I know how hard it is to keep your head up kid
And so patiently you waited for a love to come along
Take you out into this bitter world so often done you wrong
There you sit alone and there you shed a solitary tear
Listening to a song you think that no one else would ever hear
I know how hard it is to keep your head up kid
I know how hard it is to keep your head up
Keep your head up, keep your head up
Keep your head up, keep your head up"

Just goes to show the futility of self-preservation
Now all I seem to see is all this war and goin' amongst our nation
What good will it do?
Now everybody wants to know the secrets to our salvation
Forever reading on and on from Genesis to Revelation
But never stopping for a second to examine the situation
After all that we've been through
And will it only end
When there's nothing left to defend?
Will we ever see, yeah
A common bond of humanity?
I get a landscape of famine and also of frustration
With children walking 'round without the proper means to education
And still up there on Capitol Hill they're passing all of this legislation
For jails and bombs
So anybody out there hear my prayer
Anybody out there hear my prayer
Anybody out there hear my prayer

It's been a long time
Since I sat with you, my friend

And now
I'm thinking 'bout what went down
All the heartache I laughed away
Just like a clown
And now sit around talking
Drink some wine
I'm really glad you stopped in
To spend some time
You sit around talking
Thinking 'bout the past
It's funny how it lingers
But nothings meant to last
And my ma
She'd like to say hello
But she's a little scared
That I can't let it go
So let on, ease back, brother
And let it slip away
I'm tired of hanging onto
The pains of yesterday
And once again
The money is so thick
It makes your heart go numb
It makes your mind get sick
So come on by, stay and talk about it
Drink some wine
I'm really glad you stopped in
Brother of mine
We'll sit around talking, drink some wine
And maybe by the morning
Everything is fine, everything is fine
Ease back, brother
Let this clear your mind
Come on by
And drink yourself a good time
Have some wine
And think about each other
Sister, am I fine?
Yes, I've been alright now
Take it lightly
Step on out the front door

If I be a rambling boy
The sporting life

Met a lady from Louisville
A-pleasing to my mind
She took my hand and said
Would you please be kind
And from the foggy dew I stumbled
Into a shady grove

He sang of careless love
And the bells of Rhymney rang out

For to maintain his two brothers and he
They had not been sailing but a long winter's night
And a part of a short winter's day
When he espied a stout lofty ship

Come bibbing down on him straight way
\"Hello, hello\", cried Henry Martin
What makes you sail so nigh?
I'm a rich merchant ship bound for fair London Town
London Town, London Town
Would you please for to let me pass by?
\"Oh no, oh no\", cried Henry Martin
This thing it never could be
For I have turned robber all on the salt sea
Salt sea, the salt sea.
For to maintain my two brothers and me
Come lower your tops'l and brail up your mizz'n
And bring your ship under my lee
Or I will give you a full cannon ball

And all your dear bodies drown in the salt sea
Oh no, we won't lower our lofty topsail
Nor bring our ship under your lee
And you shan't take from us our rich merchant goods

Nor point our bold guns to the sea

For fully two hours or three

My food was your beauty and my water your song
I returned for your voice and your precious melody
I heard them both but you sang not for me
Did you sleep well, did you sleep fine?
Did you sleep much at all?
All night I heard two voices from out here in the hall
The first was a flower and the second was a train
The first issued warning and the second brought the rain
Day is breaking, it's time for me to leave
Each breath I'm taking reminds me to grieve
You've proven false but another will be true
Walking tall in the darkness the whole night through
Will you sleep well, will you sleep fine?
Will you sleep much at all?
All night you'll hear two voices from out there in the hall
The first will be a mirror and the second one a dove
The first will be an echo and the second silent love
Will you sleep well, will you sleep fine?
Will you sleep much at all?

To a song that doesnt rhyme
All I can give you is this pool Im in
And I forgive you if you find that you cannot swim
Stop me from thinking of what I once knew
Save me from sinking in the river of your eyes so blue
Sit down beside me
Sing to me a song
Play me a fiddle tune and forget about what we did wrong
How we stayed away too long
Draw me a picture of a lonesome turtle dove
Write me a line of verse that was sent from heaven above

I came to my love Flora
Some pleasure there to find
She turned in to another man
Which sort of stressed my mind
She robbed me of my loyalty
Deprived me of my rest
I loved my faithless Flora
The Lily of the West
Now down in yonder shady grove
The man who was to come
Conversing with my Flora there
It seemed so strange to me
And the answer that she gave to him
It sort of me oppressed
I was betrayed by Flora
The Lily of the West
I stepped up to my rival
My dagger in my hand
I seized him by the collar
And I boldly made him stand
We met in desperation
I pierced him in the breast
I killed the man for Flora

A literal translation by j. mark sugars 1997
Once I was a gentle maiden,
But now I am a spent, worn-out widow,
My consort strongly plowing the waves
Over the hills and far away.
He is my hero, my gallant darling,
He is my caesar, a gallant darling;
I've found neither rest nor fortune
Since my gallant darling went far away.
Every day I am constantly enduring grief,
Weeping nitterly and shedding tears,
Because my lively lad has left me
And no news is told of him - alas!
The cuckoo does not sing cheerfully at noon
And the sound of hounds is not heard in nut-tree woods
Nor summer morning in misty glen
Since my lively boy went away from me.
Noble, proud young horseman,
Youth without gloom, of pleasant countenance,
A swift-moving fist, nimble in a fight,
Slaying the enemy and smiting the strong.
Let a strain be played on musical harps,
And let many quarts be filled on the table,
With high spirit, without fault, without gloom,
That my lion may receive long life and health.
Gallant darling for a while under sorrow,
And ireland completely under black cloacks,
I have found neither rest nor fortune
Since my gallant darling went far away"

And I call her lovely Molly O', the lily of the west
One day as I was walkin' down by a shady grove
I spied a lord of high degree conversing with my love
She sang her song delightfully while I was sore oppressed
Saying I've been a dupe [I bid adieu?] to Molly O', the lily of the west
Well, I stepped up with my rapier and my dagger in my hand
And I dragged him from my false love and boldly I bid him stand
But being mad with desperation I swore I'd pierce his breast
I was then deceived by Molly O', the lily of the west
A flaw was in my indictment found and that soon had me free
That beauty bright I did adore, the judge did her address
Now go, you faithless Molly O', the lily of the west
Now that I've gained my liberty a-rowin' I will go
I ramble through old Ireland and travel Scotland o'er
Though she thought to swear my life away she still disturbs my rest,
I still must style her, Molly O', the lily of the west."
"265" "I was down the glen one Easter morn
To a city fair rode I
There armed lines of marching men
In squadrons passed me by
No pipe did hum, no battle drum did sound it's loud tattoo
But the Angelus Bells o'er the Liffey swells rang out in the foggy dew
Right proudly high in Dublin town
Hung they out a flag of war
'Twas better to die 'neath that Irish sky
Than at Sulva or Sud el Bar
And from the plains of Royal Meath
Strong men came hurrying through
While Brittania's huns with their long range guns
Sailed in through the foggy dew
Their bravest fell and the requiem bell
Rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Eastertide in the
Springing of the year
While the world did gaze with deep amaze
At those fearless men but few
Who bore the fight that freedom's light
Might shine through the foggy dew
And back through the glen
I rode again
And my heart with grief was sore
For I parted then with valiant men
Whom I never shall see n'more
But to and fro in my dreams I go
And I kneel and pray for you
For slavery fled oh glorious dead
When you fell in the foggy dew"
"266" "Have I told you lately that I love you?
Have I told you there's no one above you?
Fill my heart with gladness, take away my sadness
Ease my troubles that's what you do
Oh, the morning sun in all it's glory
Greets the day with hope and comfort too
And you fill my life with laughter, you can make it better
Ease my troubles that's what you do
There's a love that's divine
And it's yours and it's mine
Like the sun at the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray to the One
Say, have I told you lately that I love you?
Have I told you there's no one above you?
Fill my heart with gladness, take away my sadness
Ease my troubles that's what you do
Well, there's a love that's divine
And it's yours and it's mine
And it shines like the sun
At the end of the day
We will give thanks
And pray to the One
Have I told you lately that I love you?
Have I told you there's no one above you
Fill my heart with gladness, take away my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do
Take away my sadness
Fill my life with gladness
Ease my troubles that's what you do
Fill my life with gladness
Take away my sadness
Ease my troubles that's what you do"

A literal translation by j. mark sugars 1997
Once I was a gentle maiden,
But now I am a spent, worn-out widow,
My consort strongly plowing the waves
Over the hills and far away.
He is my hero, my gallant darling,
He is my caesar, a gallant darling;
I've found neither rest nor fortune
Since my gallant darling went far away.
Every day I am constantly enduring grief,
Weeping nitterly and shedding tears,
Because my lively lad has left me
And no news is told of him - alas!
The cuckoo does not sing cheerfully at noon
And the sound of hounds is not heard in nut-tree woods
Nor summer morning in misty glen
Since my lively boy went away from me.
Noble, proud young horseman,
Youth without gloom, of pleasant countenance,
A swift-moving fist, nimble in a fight,
Slaying the enemy and smiting the strong.
Let a strain be played on musical harps,
And let many quarts be filled on the table,
With high spirit, without fault, without gloom,
That my lion may receive long life and health.
Gallant darling for a while under sorrow,
And ireland completely under black cloacks,
I have found neither rest nor fortune
Since my gallant darling went far away"
"270" "In the merry month of may, from me home I started left the girls of Tuam,
Sad and broken hearted, salute me father dear,
And kissed me darlin' mother, drank a pint of beer,
Me tears and grief to smother, off to reap the corn,
Leave where I was born, I cut a stoat black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins,
In a pair of brand new of brogues, I rattled over the bogs, frightened all the dogs,
On the rocky road to Dublin, 1,2,3,4,5
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road,
And all the way to Dublin, whacks fer al de da!
In Dublin next arrived, and thought it such a pity to be so soon deprived,
A view of that fair city, then I took a stroll,
All amongst the quality, me bundle it was stole,
In that neat locality, something crossed me mind, when I looked behind,
No bundle I could find, upon me stick a wobblin. Enquiring after the rogue,
Said me Connaught brogue, was not much in vogue,
On the rocky road to Dublin, 1,2,3,4,5
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road,
And all the way to Dublin, whacks fer al de da!
The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed, called meself a fool,
I could no longer stand it, me blood began to boil,
Me temper I was losing, for old Erin's isle,
They began abusing, horah say I, me Shelelagh I let fly,
Some Galway boys were by, they saw I was a hobblin',
With a loud hurray, they joined in the afray,
We quickly cleared the way,
For the rocky road to Dublin, 1,2,3,4,5
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road,
And all the way to Dublin, whacks fer al de da!"
"271" "Ten years ago on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall light
Just a few at the scene, and they all did agree
That the man who ran looked a lot like me
The judge said \"Son, what's your alibi?
If you were somewheres else, then you won't have to die\"
But I spoke not a word, tho' it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife
Chorus:
She walks these hills in a long black veil
Visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows, but me
The scaffold is high, eternity near
She stands in the crowd, she sheds not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan
In a long black veil, she cries o'er my bones"

Stood a lowly cattle shed,
Where a mother laid her Baby

Jesus Christ her little Child.

Who is God and Lord of all,
And His shelter was a stable,
And His cradle was a stall.
With the poor and mean and lowly
Lived on earth our Saviour holy.
And our eyes at last shall see Him
Through His own redeeming love,
For that CHild so dear and gentle
Is our Lord in heaven above.

To save us all from Satan's power

This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy

A blessed Angel came;
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name.

Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

\"Let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Saviour
Of a pure Virgin bright,
To free all those who trust in Him
From Satan's power and might.\"
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind:
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy
And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay,
They found Him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His Mother Mary kneeling down,
Unto the Lord did pray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy
Now to the Lord sing praises,

And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace;

All other doth deface.

Sing all that hear in heaven God's holy word.

Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep;
To whom God's angels did appear,
Which put the shepherds in great fear.

'To Bethlehem, be not afraid,
For there you'll find this happy morn,
A princely babe, sweet Jesus born.
There were three wise men from afar
Directed by a glorious star,
And on they wandered night and day
Until they came where Jesus lay,
And when they came unto that place
Where our beloved Messiah was,
They humbly laid at his feet,
Their gifts of gold and incense sweet."

Til the beer is all spilled and the whiskey has flowed.
And the whole family tree you neglected to bury,
Are feeding their faces until they explode.

There'll be laughter and tears over Tia Marias,
Mixed up with that drink made from girders.
Cause it's all we've got left as they draw their last breath,
Ah, it's nice for the kids, as you finally get rid of them,
In the St Stephen's Day Murders.
Uncle is garglin' a heart-breaking air,
While the babe in his arms pulls out all that remains of his hair.
And we're not drunk enough yet to dare criticize,
The great big kipper tie he's about to baptize.
With his gin-flavored whiskers and kisses of sherry,
His best Chrimbo shirt slung out over the shop.
While the lights from the Christmas tree blow up the telly,
His face closes in like an old cold pork chop.
And the carcass of the beast left over from the feast,
May still be found haunting the kitchen.
And there's life in it yet, we may live to regret,
When the ones that we poisoned stop twitchin'.

We give to our relations
And perhaps we give a little to the poor
If the generosity should seize us
But if any one of us should interfere

Turn out the light
Cant we just pretend tonight?
That weve got nothing
That weve got nothing
That weve got nothing
To fear
Hold me like a baby
Rock me in a cradle
And whisper, nothing
Whisper, nothing
Sweet whisper, nothing
In my ear
(ohhh)

Oh, let me hide out in your bed
And think of, nothing
And think of, nothing
Think of, nothing
But here"

This is not my kind of bliss
My painted lips are numb
In this stranger's empty kiss
I saw shadows at your feet
My empty shoes have left me here
I knew then that the rain would come
When we watched the rainbow disappear
I'm not missing you
I'm not staring into space
I'm not blue, I'm not blue
I'm not holding on
Even to the lack of you
I'm not running movies in my head
I'm not searching for your feet in bed
I'm not sleeping in your t-shirt
Baby I'm not making tea for two
I'm not missing you
I'm not staring into space
I'm not blue, I'm not blue
And dreams will fly
Just one more night
And I'll let you go
Just like a kite
I won't turn around
I'll wake up singing again
For the first time and forever
I say a million times goodnight
It seems easier to love everybody
Than to love just one man right
I'm not missing you
I'm not staring into space
I'm not blue, I'm not blue
I'm not missing you
I'm not staring into space
I'm not blue, I'm not blue

Oh
Oh
Oh, oh"
"326" "Whys it always such a big surprise
When you let me know whats going on inside
A secret truth
Everywhere
But now youre standing so bare
I dreamed of love
With an open palm
But now your fingers start to curl
I lay my head against the stone
Am I, am I, not your girl
I know
That love comes and it goes
I want it
To stick around this time
I touched the bottom of the cake
And now I dont know what to say
It feels like we
Are worlds apart
But you are just a room away
Are you a memory or are you a dream
I seem to conjure you from both
Are your pools blue?
Or grey-green?
Is my love deep enough?
I know
Love comes and it goes
I want it to
Stick around this time
This time, this time
This time
Will we see what the morning brings?
See what the morning brings
See what the morning brings
See what the morning brings
Can I trust the man
Who loves another?
Or do I want a man
Who can only love me?
Is this the middle?
Is this the end?
Lets walk a little
We shall
See what the morning brings
See what the morning brings
See what the morning brings
See what the morning brings
See what the morning brings
See what the morning brings
See what the morning brings
See what the morning brings

Natures taking over

Im too far gone to turn from you
What are we gonna do?
I was not the type to fall from grace
But I lost my footing when I saw your face
And Id break every rule I make
Will this be my last mistake?
Its only love, that Im seeking
Its only love, that Im seeking
I played out this scene a hundred times
But now I look at your mouth and I forget my lines
You draw me in just like a cigarette
One morning dawn with a head full of regret
My life is made up with the things I said I wouldnt do
Now here I am standing in front of you
It seems theres only trouble and desire
Im standing on a wire, Im sitting in a fire
Its only love that Im seeking
Its only love that Im seeking
Its only love, its only love
I cant yell any louder
I cant breathe any deeper
I cant hold on a little longer
I cant sing any stronger
I cant turn it on
I cant turn it off
I cant keep this type from rising
I cant contain this yearning
I cant stop this fire

Im too far gone to turn from you

Its only love that Im seeking
Its only love, its only love

Would you understand?
Could you promise that youd keep it?

Are we going nowhere?
I cant see the future
Are we already there?
I wanna laugh like I used to
Cry like I could with you
I dont know where
We go from here
Come lay down beside me
And Ill tell you a story
Lay your head upon your pillow
Look outside your window
Ill be the stars
Ill be the stars

You and me
Nothing is forever
The winds are calling me
You know I wanna know what peace is
But I pulled it all to pieces

Well mostly Ive been walking
Having conversations with God
Where I do all the talking
Just to find the will to live
Is a search that takes me far and wide
Sometimes the suburbs of paradise
Leave a lot to be desired
Will I rise, will I rise up?
Will I rise, will I rise, up?
As I crawl around my house
I think I could just disappear
I keep looking in the mirror
Just to see if Im still here
Maybe we could overthrow
The political campaign
With all this blood on our hands
Weve only got ourselves to blame
Will we rise, will we rise up?
Will we rise, will we rise up?
Will we rise... up?
Will we rise... up?
The road ahead is all the shiver
But is the past through with me yet?
All the sins of the father
That Im trying to forget
Whys it take a world of love
To let just a little in
Theres a murmur in my heart
But it might be only spring
Will it rise, will it rise up?
Will it rise, will it rise up?
Will we rise... up?
Will we rise, will we rise up?

So far away today
Let me tell you that I love you
That I think about you all the time
Caledonia you're calling me

Now I have moved and I've kept on moving
Proved the points that I needed proving
Lost the friends that I needed losing
Found others on the way
I've kissed the fellas and left them crying
Stolen dreams, yes, there's no denying
I've traveled hard sometimes with conscience flying
Somewhere with the wind

That I think about you all the time
Caledonia you're calling me
Now I'm going home
But if I should become a stranger
Know that it would make me more than sad
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had
Now I'm sitting here before the fire
The empty room, the forest choir
The flames have cooled, don't get any higher
They've withered now, they've gone
But I'm steady thinking my way is clear
And I know what I will do tomorrow
When hands have shaken, the kisses flowed
Then I will disappear
Let me tell you that I love you
That I think about you all the time
Caledonia you're calling me
Now I'm going home

As girls who dressed up gaily
And we'll be dancing till the dawn

The ones they come from miles around
From Venice and from

They're playing tunes on everything
From pipes to ukulele
It sounds so good you can't sit down
We're dancing At The Ceili

My own true love has sailed away
To be an endless rover
Cause times are tough and he will save
To start a new life over
He writes me letters every week
To say how much he's slavin'
And he promises that he'll be back
Before the hay needs savin'
But it's hard to love somebody
That you're not in touch with daily
So I'm looking for somebody new
Tonight down At The Ceili
The winter nights are long and hard
And time goes by so slowly
I wish my true love he was here
And in his arms I'd go
He'd whisper tender words of love to me
And kiss my lips so sweetly
And quickly I'd surrender to
His manly charms completely

The flowered or the funny
What on earth am I to do
It's driving me half crazy
Tonight I'll make my mind up
When I see them At The Ceili
To be a poor man's wife will be
A life of washing dishes
When a rich man's wife will surely have
Great luxury and riches
In comfort how I know
It wouldn't be too hard to wallow
But being poor is that much fun
Which one should I follow?

No flower of her kindred, no rosebud is nigh

Since the lovely are sleeping, go sleep thou with them
Thus kindly I scatter thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden lie scentless and dead
So soon may I follow when friendships decay
And from love's shining circle the gems drop away
When true hearts lie withered and fond ones are flown
Oh who would inhabit this bleak world alone?
This bleak world alone"

With vassals and serfs at my side,
And of all who assembled within those walls

I had riches all too great to count, could boast
Of a high ancestral name.
But I also dreamt which pleased me most
That you loved me still the same,
That you loved me
You loved me still the same,
That you loved me
You loved me still the same.
I dreamt that suitors sought my hand,
That knights upon bended knee
And with vows no maidens heart could withstand,
They pledged their faith to me.
And I dreamt that one of that noble host
Came forth my hand to claim.
But I also dreamt which charmed me most
That you loved me still the same
That you loved me
You loved me still the same,
That you loved me
You loved me still the same."

Only for nights in Ballygrand
I would swim over the deepest ocean
The deepest ocean for my love to find
But the sea is wide and I cannot swim over
Neither have I wings to fly
If I could find me a handsome boatsman
To ferry me over to my love and die
My childhood days bring back sad reflections
Of happy times spent so long ago
My childhood friends and my own relations
Have all passed on now like melting snow
But I'll spend my days in endless roaming
Soft is the grass, my bed is free
Ah, to be back now in Carrickfergus
On that long road down to the sea"

Forgotten is the race that no one knows

They saw a bright new shining star,
And hear a choir from heaven sing, the music came from afar.
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a new king born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.
Now Joseph and his wife, Mary, came to Bethlehem that night,
They found no place to bear her child, not a single room was in sight.
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a new king born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.
By and by they found a nook in a stable all forlorn,
And in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little child was born.
Trumpets sound and angels sing
Listen to what they say

Which like a blossoming to heaven rise

"381" "Walking in the air
Floating in the sky
Floating in the air
We're walking in the air
We're floating in the moonlit sky
The people far below are sleeping as we fly
We're holding very tight
I'm riding in the midnight blue
And finding I can fly so high above with you
All across the world
The villages go by like dreams
The rivers and the hills, the forests and the streams
Children gaze open-mouthed
Taken by surprise
Nobody down below, believes their eyes
We're surfing in the air
We're swimming in the frozen sky
We're drifting over icy mountains floating by
Suddenly swooping low
On an ocean deep
Rising up a mighty monster from his sleep
We're walking in the air
We're dancing in the midnight sky
And everyone who sees us greets us as we fly"
"382" "I hear a baby crying
A sad sound, a lonely sound
I want to take her in my arms
And then I dry away all her tears
I see a boy who's frightened
A young boy with old eyes
I long to say you're welcome here
You can be happy now that you're warm
We're all a part of one world
We all can share the same dream
And if you just reach out to me
Then you will find deep down inside
I'm just like you
Loud voices raised in anger
Speak harsh words such cruel words
Why do they speak so selfishly
When we have got so much we can share?
So let your hearts be open
And reach out with all your love
There are no strangers now
They are our brothers now and we are one
We're all a part of one world
We all can share the same dream
And if you just reach out to me
Then you will find deep down inside
I'm just like you
We're all a part of one world
We all can share the same dream
And if you just reach out to me
Then you will find deep down inside
I'm just like you, I'm just like you"
"383" "I've met some folks who say that I'm a dreamer
And I've no doubt there's truth in what they say
But sure a body's bound to be a dreamer
When all the things he loves are far away
And precious things are dreams unto an exile
They take him o'er the land across the sea
Especially when it happens he's an exile
From that dear lovely Isle of Inisfree
And when the moonlight peeps across the rooftops
Of this great city, wondrous though it be
I scarcely feel its wonder or its laughter
I'm once again back home in Inisfree
I wander o'er green hills through dreamy valleys
And find a peace no other land would know
I hear the birds make music fit for angels
And watch the rivers laughing as they flow
And then into a humble shack I wander
My dear old home and tenderly behold
The folks I love around the turf fire, gathered
On bended knees, their rosary is told
But dreams don't last
Though dreams are not forgotten
And soon I'm back to stern reality
But though they pave the footways here with gold dust
I still would choose my Isle of Inisfree"
"384" "When the light begins to fade
And shadows fall across the sea,
One bright star in the evening sky
Your love's light leads me on my way
There's a dream that will not sleep,
A burning hope that will not die
So I must go now with the wind,
And leave you waiting on the tide
Time to fly, time to touch the sky
One voice alone, a haunting cry
One song, one star burning bright,
May it carry me through darkest night
Rain comes over the gray hills,
And on the air, a soft goodbye
Hear the song that I sing to you
When the time has come to fly"

Face the wind now so wild and so strong

Don't forget what you're leaving me for
Don't forget when your missing these souls
Love must never hold never hold tight but let go
O the nights will be long
When I'm not in your arms
But I'll be in the song
That you sing to me across the sea
Somehow someday
You'll be faraway so far from me
And maybe one day I will follow you
In all you do
'Till then send me a song
When the sun sets the water will fire
When the winds swells the sails ever higher
Let the call of the bird on the wind
Calm your sadness and lonleness
And then start to sing to me
I will sing to you if you promise
To send me a song
I'll walk by the shore and I hear
Hear your song come so faint and so clear
And I catch it a breath on the wind
And I smile and I sing you song
I will send you a song
I will sing you a song
I will sing to you if you promise to send me a song"
"388" "Words by Grian MacGregor
Music by Jay Ungar
The sun is sinking low in the sky above Ashokan.
The pines and the willows know soon we will part.
There's a whisper in the wind of promises unspoken,
And a love that will always remain in my heart.
My thoughts will return to the sound of your laughter,
The magic of moving as one,
And a time we'll remember long ever after
The moonlight and music and dancing are done.
Will we climb the hills once more?
Will we walk the woods together?
Will I feel you holding me close once again?
Will every song we've sung stay with us forever?
Will you dance in my dreams or my arms until then?
Under the moon the mountains lie sleeping
Over the lake the stars shine.
They wonder if you and I will be keeping
The magic and music, or leave them behind.

"389" "My young love said to me, \"My mother won't mind
And my father won't slight you for your lack of kind.\"
Then she stepped away from me and this she did say:
\"It will not be long, love, till our wedding day.\"
She stepped away from me and she moved thru' the fair
And fondly I watched her move here and move there.
And she made her way homeward with one star awake
As swan in the evening moves over the lake.
Last night, She came to me, She came softly in
So softly she came that her feet made no din,
And she laid her hand on me and this she did say:
\"It will not be long, love, till our wedding day.\""
"390" "Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.
But when he come, and all the flowers are dying
If I am dead, as dead I well may be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an \"Ave\" there for me.
And I shall hear, tho' soft you tread above me
And all my grave will warm and sweeter be
For you will bend and tell me that you love me
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me."

"394" "See her as she flies
Golden sails across the sky
Close enough to touch
But careful if you try
Though she looks as warm as gold
The moon's a harsh mistress
The moon can be so cold
Once the sun did shine
And lord it felt so fine
The moon a phantom rose
Through the mountains and the pine
And then the darkness fell
The moon's a harsh mistress
It's hard to love her well
I fell out of her eyes
I fell out of her heart
I fell down on my face, yes I did
And I tripped and I missed my star
And I fell and fell alone

The moon's a harsh mistress

Time to close your eyes.
And save these questions for another day.

I think you know what I've been trying to say.
I promise I would never leave you.
And you should always know, I never will be far away.
Goodnight my angel, now it's time to sleep.
And still so many things I want to say.
Remember all the songs you sang for me.
When we went sailing on a emerald bay.
And like a boat out on the ocean.
I'm rocking you to sleep.
The water is dark and deep inside this mother's heart.
You'll always be a part of me.

There blows a lily fair
The twilight gleam is in her eye
The night is on her hair
And like a love-sick lennan-shee
She has my heart in thrall
Nor life I owe nor liberty
With love is lord of all.
And sometimes when the beetle's horn
Hath lulled the eve to sleep
I steal unto her shielding lorn
And through the dooring peep.
There on the cricket's singing stone,
She spares the bogwood fire,
And hums in sad sweet undertones
The song of heart's desire
The song of heart's desire."

The hour I first believed
Through many dangers, toils and snares
We have already come.
T'was grace that brought us safe thus far
And grace will lead us home,
And grace will lead us home

"400" "If you ever go across the sea to Ireland,
Then maybe at the closing of your day,
You can sit and watch the moon rise over Claddagh,
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay.
Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream,
The women in the meadow making hay,
Just to sit beside the turf fire in a cabin,
And watch the barefoot gosoons as they play.
Ooh
For the breezes blowing o'er the sea's from Ireland,
Are perfumed by the heather as they blow,
And the women in the uplands digging praties,
Speak a language that the strangers do not know.
Yet the strangers came and tried to teach us their ways,
And they scorned us just for being what we are,
But they might as well go chasin' after moon beams,
Or light a penny candle from a star.
And if there's gonna be a life here after,
And faith somehow I'm sure there's gonna be,
I will ask my God to let me make my Heaven,
In that dear land across the Irish sea.

"403" "On the first day on January,
Eighteen ninety-two,
They opened Ellis Island and they let
The people through.
And the first to cross the threshold
Of that isle of hope and tears,
Was Annie Moore from Ireland
Who was all of fifteen years.
[Chorus]
Isle of hope, isle of tears,
Isle of freedom, isle of fears,
But it's not the isle you left behind.
That isle of hunger, isle of pain,
Isle you'll never see again
But the isle of home is always on your mind.
In a little bag she carried
All her past and history,
And her dreams for the future
In the land of liberty.
And courage is the passport
When your old world disappears
But there's no future in the past
When you're fifteen years
[Chorus]
When they closed down Ellis Island
In nineteen forty-three,
Seventeen million people
Had come there for sanctuary.
And in springtime when I came here
And I stepped onto it's piers,
I thought of how it must have been
When you're fifteen years.

With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid

Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe
In this time of fear
When prayers so often prove(s) in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My heart's so full I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say
There can be miracles, when you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe
They don't (always happen) when you ask
(Oh)
And it's easy to give in to your fears
(Oh, oh)
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way straight thought the rain

Says (hope is very near)

But love grows old and waxes cold
And fades away like morning dew
There is a ship, and she sails the sea
She's loaded deep, as deep can be
But not as deep as the love I'm in
I know not how I sink or swim
The water is wide, I can't cross o'er
And neither have I wings to fly

Skies too high without you
Losing my way on silent roads without you
Long lone streets before me
No voice in the night to warn me
No sound of our songs
To bring you to me

Stars send me astray
Walking the night without you
Blind in sight without you
No song I learn
No way I turn
Brings you closer to me
Searching for songs without you
Moon so cold without you
Longing to be near
Straining to hear
A song from you
Walking the stars without you
It's calling through the dark
It's reeling in the heart
The sound of the pipes on the wind
The strains of the song
Carry me along
Sending me dancing again
From above and below
A sound soft and low
And the music's flowing through me like before
And the song that we once knew
Brings me back to you
Pipes play within me once more
Your songs are in my heart
They light the dark
So come give me your hand
Now and we'll dance tonight
In the blazing light
And the years will fade away
Fade as you play
Play through the dark
Play in my heart
I'm spinning with the sound
There a drumming in the ground
And the humming of the song beneath my skin
And the world falls away
As I hear the pipes play
Sounding the song from within
From within
Your songs are in my heart
They like a dart
So come give me your hand
Now and we'll dance tonight
In the blazing light
And the years will fade away
Fade as you play
Play through the dark
Play in my heart
There's a drumming in the ground
And the humming of a sound
That we once knew
Come sing through the night
Come fill me with your light
Play a song sounding out through the years
Play it steady and strong
Fill me with song
Sending me dancing, sending me dancing
Dance as the pipes play away in my heart
Come give me your hand tonight
Your star is bright
Your songs are in my heart!"

And over a village he halted his craft,
And it hung in the sky like a star, just like a star,
He followed a light, and came down to a shed,
Where a mother and child were lying there on a bed,
A bright light of silver shone round his head,
And he had the face of an angel, and they were afraid,
Then the stranger spoke, he said, \"do not fear,
I come from a planet a long way from here,
And I bring a message for mankind to hear\",
And suddenly the sweetest music, filled the air,

And many were awakened on hearing that sound,
And travelers on the road the village they found,
By the light of that ship in the sky,
Which shone all around,
And just before dawn, at the paling of the sky,
The stranger returned and said \"now I must fly,
When two thousand years of your time has gone by,
This song will begin once again, to a baby's cry\",
And it went la la la la la la la la la la,

To God with love this Christmas day

There was a blessed Messiah born
Near Bethlehem did shepherds keep
Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep
To whom God's angels did appear
Which put the shepherds in great fear
\"Arise and go\", the angels said
\"To Bethlehem, be not afraid
For there you'll find this happy morn'
A princely Babe, sweet Jesus born\"
With thankful heart and joyful mind
The shepherds went that Babe to find
And as God's angel had foretold
They did our Savior Christ behold
Within a manger He was laid
And by his side the Virgin maid
As long foretold upon that morn'
There was a blessed Messiah born"

Run your claw along my gut, one last time

Deep from the earth how sweet the sound

There's a whisper in the wind of promises unspoken,
And a love that will always remain in my heart.
My thoughts will return to the sound of your laughter,
The magic of moving as one,
And a time we'll remember long ever after
The moonlight and music and dancing are done.
Will we climb the hills once more?
Will we walk the woods together?
Will I feel you holding me close once again?
Will every song we've sung stay with us forever?
Will you dance in my dreams or my arms until then?

Over the lake the stars shine.
They wonder if you and I will be keeping
The magic and music, or leave them behind."

And all trees that do abound
The ones that please my heart the most
Are green the whole year 'round

Are green the whole year 'round
When summer comes and the days are hot
And the birds are full of song
In the quiet shade of that leafy glade
That is where my heart belongs

That is where you can be found
As you take your ease 'neath your favorite trees
That are green the whole year 'round
Green the whole year 'round,
Green the whole year 'round,
The holly yew and the ivy tree
Are green the whole year 'round
But the summer fades and the days grow short
And the autumn winds they blow
And the leaves of gold come tumbling down
To the forest far below
Memories of other days come tumbling from the past
To remind us, like the seasons do
That life goes by so fast
The winter lays her fingers cold
On dark and lonely nights
But christmas it will soon be here
To usher in the light
And when morning breaks and the bells ring out
It is such a joyous sound
To hear them echo in the trees
That are green the whole year 'round
Green the whole year 'round,
Green the whole year 'round,
The holly yew and the ivy tree
Are green the whole year 'round
Green the whole year 'round,

The rivers and the hills, the forests and the streams
Children gaze open-mouthed
Taken by surprise
Nobody down below, believes their eyes

And glitters on the thorn

The angel song to hear
In manger cradle, as he lay
To greet the Saviour dear

Shone forth that Christmas morn

Ablaze in wonder and in awe
As every heart adores

And oÃ¢E(tm)er the child a guiding star

Well, it's not his fault-No! He's not to blame
He's been in jail for all these years
And it's not for drunk driving (he never drinks liquor maybe 1 or 2 beer)
No! They thought he might have robbed the train
And when they found out he was innocent, they kept him in jail because they thought he was insane
I guess that red suit gave him away
They said anyone who dresses like that must be insane (that's what they did say)
Well after all hope fails, all hope fails
And because they think he's insane, they won't let him get no bail

(Chorus)
And I will be there for you.
I will fight for you.
And its too late, to make it out of here.
It's too late.
But would you save all the others?
Would you save all the others?
Would you save all the others?
woooahwoooahwoooah...
I heard you, whistling in the garden.
All I ever wanted from you was to hear I had your pardon.
woooahwoooahwoooah..."

"486" "My young man, oh he is so fine,
Sweet Rosemary did say.
She gathered flowers and she sang
All about her wedding day.
Oh when I was a lass at school
I looked out at the sky,
And now among the woodlands cool,
Gathering sweet primroses I.
I wish I was a little bird,
With wings that I could fly,
Then I would find my own true love,
And when he'd speak then I'd be by.
My heart would flutter like the wings,
Oh to see my own dear one.
And pretty words I'd like to sing
All beneath the morning sun."
"487" "If your eyes are blue you know the rest
Champagne if it's very cool
It's never very formal how you dress
For oysters by the swimming pool
Then slip away into the mountainside
Like the man in the Lazy E'
It's great to have a place where you can hide
Why you must amazes me
[Chorus]
Golden,
Where are you?
Sold on gold dust
I shuttled all around America
From New York to Los Angeles
Nervous breakdown later, there we were
From Liberty to redwood trees
A friend of mine, she hitched from east to west
In time to hear my final song
It seems to me she tried her very best
She is a good companion
[Chorus]
He stores away the moments of her smiles
As if they were rare butterflies
Stalks his prey for miles and miles and miles
Then barters for the merchandise
When Life it drags the likes of me around
Just when we need some time alone
You have a simple mansion underground
Without address or telephone
[Chorus]"
"488" "We search for everything
Keeping what we would win
Orchids or tiny flowers
Wooden huts or ivory towers
Centuries or hours
Dark are the winter days
Holy in many ways
Vaults of time unshaken
Whilst as through them we are taken
Sleeping forests wake
Ice melts on the lake
Birds begin in making their way back home
The frost and the fire goes
East winds and winter snows
Sun upon the daffodils
Dancing on the verdant hills
Lambs in the fields
Warmer grows the morning sun
Days of youthfulness and fun
The prime of the year begun
The song of summer to be sung
Everything is one
Working day is done
Watch the river running through our lives
How slowly the colors change
We feel the drops of rain
Mists of evening rise again
We rarely stroll the shadowed lanes
As autumn night draws in
We sit upon the sand
Warmth draining from the land
Watching the ruby sun
Setting on the ocean
The echoes in the caves
The flame upon the waves
Memories for saving all our days"
"489" "(By Sandy Denny. U.F.O. Music, Inc. (C) 1972)
The lady she had a silver longue.
For to sing she said,
And maybe that's all.
Wait for the dawn and we will have that song.
When it ends it will seem
That we hear silence fall.
The lady she had a golden heart,
For to love she said
And she did not lie.
Wait for the dawn and we'll watch for the sun.
As we turn it will seem
To arise in the sky.
We heard that song while watching the skies,
Oh the sound it rang,
So clear through the cold.
Then silence fell and the sun did arise
On a beautiful morning of silver and gold."
"490" "Although the flames they are so dim,
I can see them from over here.
But this is no time to worry now,
No time to shed a tear.
The people are all smiling,
And the letters are all too,
The flowers they are all arranged
And the notes they are all blue.
Where are the words to say to you,
Where do they all begin.
I should not have a lot to lose
And everything to win.
And I want you to be smiling,
I want you not to cry.
And even if I hide away,
Then you'll get the notion why.
A symphony I learnt at school,
In pigeonholes so clear,
But it made me for to write no songs,
For nobody to hear.
And I see you are all smiling
Even in the candle light.
Just close your eyes and fall asleep,
And I think you'll be alright.
Close your eyes and fall asleep,
And I think you'll be alright."
"491" "(Sandy Denny)
They stood upon the deck
As the ship went out to sea
The wind it took the sails
And left the land a memory
All upon the shore for
To wonder why the sailor goes
All to close their eyes
And wonder what the sailor knows
That is you to they
That is how they think you are
Never on the land
But sailing by the north star
That is you to them
That is how they think you are
Never on the land
But sailing by the north star
To the tower and to the ravens and
The tale that hopes they'll never leave
What if they should go?
We always dread to think of them
I wonder if they flew one day
And no one ever knew they'd gone
To circle over ships at sea
Claiming yet another son
That is you to me
That is where I think you are
Never on the land
But gone to find the north star"
"492" "The wine it was drunk, the ship it was sunk,
The shot it was dead, all the sorrows were drowned.
The birds they were clouds, the brides and the shrouds
And as we drew south the mist it came down.
The wooded ravine to the wandering stream,
The serpent he moved, but no-one would say.
The depths of the waters, the bridge which distraught us
And brought to me thoughts of the ill-fated day.
The temples were filled with the strangest of creatures
One played it by ear on the banks of the sea.
That one was found but the others they went under.
Oh the tears which are shed, they won't come from me.
The methods of madness, the pathos and the sadness,
God help you all, the insane and wise.
The black and the white, the darkness of the night,
I see only smoke from the chimneys arise."
"493" "(By Sandy Denny. U.F.O. Music, Inc. (C) 1972)
I'm a long way from you,
I'm a long way from home.
And who cares for the f
Of being alone.
The notes and the words
They will always unfold
And I'm left with a manuscript
That will grow old
And the secret's all told anyway.
So the song it is yours,
And the song it is mine.
And a cold wind it blows
Through good fortunes of time.
The hobo he leaves
When the going is bad
And the music he weaves
Is so gentle and sad.
But freedom he has anyway.

"494" "Such sweet love is so hard to find
Look around, these are troublesome times
The sun beats down on our hunger and thirst
It would soon all be over if we let it be worse
[Chorus]
Take me away, take me away
Take me away, take me away
If not for you how would I keep going
No one to be near, no good fortune to know
Take my hand, make me feel stronger
You're a man - progress is slow
[Chorus]
There will be rain clouds, for harvest to grow
We'll find the rain clouds, and the rivers will flow
Leave what is past, search for the future
Leave this black dream for it's high time to go
[Chorus]"

Oh it's like a storm at sea,
And everything is lost
And, the fretful sailors
Calling out their woes,
As to the waves they're tossed.
Oh, they are all gentlemen,
And never will they know
If there is a reason each of them
Must go,
To join the cruel flow.
And it'll take a long long time
It'll take a long long time
It'll take a long long time,
Oh it'll take such a long long time.
There is no need for rules,
There's no one to score the game
And there is no body
Living in this town
As even knows its name.
And it'll take a long long time
It'll take a long long time
It'll take a long long time,
Long long time."
"496" "Oh, babe, you are the one I love,
You are the one I'm thinking of.
You know it's still a long long way,
But I'll be home at the end of the day.
I'll sing my songs just for you
And I'll bring my love home to you.
I can hardly wait to see your face again,
But I'll be home at the end of the day.
Just miles and miles of rosy sky,
I'll fall asleep by and by.
I'm crying now 'cause you're so far away
But I'll be home at the end of the day.
Oh, babe, you are the one I love,
You are the one I'm thinking of.
So many words I need to say.
You'll hear them all at the end of the day.
But I'll be home at the end of the day."
"497" "Why do you whisper, green grass,
Why tell the trees what ain't so?
Whispering grass,
The trees don't have to know.
Why tell them all your secrets,
Who kissed there long ago?
Whispering grass,
The trees don't need to know.
Don't you tell it to the breeze,
'Cause she will tell the birds and bees,
And everyone will know
Because you told them once before.
Yes you told them once before,
It's no secret anymore.
Why tell them all the old things,
They're buried under the snow.
Whispering grass, don't tell the trees,
'Cause the trees don't need to know.
Now don't you tell it to the breeze

Whispering grass, don't tell the trees,

"498" "I've watched you rise up and I've watched you fall down
'Til you've lost everything but what money can own.
And you feel alright now, but for how long?
You feel alright now, how long?
Do me a favour, stay away from my door.
I could use some good company but I don't care for yours.
No more pageants, no more.
No more pageants, no more.
I find your words empty and you know as a rule
To you I have purposefully never been cruel.
But you waste my time, such fools.
You waste my time, such fools.
My love is not here, my love is away.
You've caught me alone but you've nothing to say.
And it's time to leave now and you know the way.
And it's time to leave and you know the way.
Go and live in the country and I'll stay in town.
I have everything but what money can own.
And I'll be just fine now, so long.
I'll be just fine now, so long.
So long."
"499" "I don't want your lonely mansion
With a tear in every room
All I want's the love you've promised
Beneath the halo moon
But you think I should be happy
With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrows
While you play your cheatin' game
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your mind
You can't buy my love with money
'Cause I ain't never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine
And I dare not drown my sorrows
In the warm glow of your mind
You can't buy my love with money
'Cause I ain't never was that kind
Silver threads and golden needles
Cannot mend this heart of mine"
"500" "Then came the question and it was about time.
The answer came back and it was long.
The house it was built by some man in a rhyme,
But whatever came of his talented son?
Who wrote me a dialogue set to a tune?
Always you told me of being alone,
Except for the stories about God and you,
And do you still live there in Buffalo?
They put up the walls with no more to say,
Nobody stopped to ask why it was done.
The stream was too far and the rain was too high,
So into the city the river did run.
Because of the architect the buildings fell down,
Smothered or drowned all the seeds which were sown.
I wish I were somewhere, but not in this town.
Maybe the ocean next time around.
I seem to remember the face and the name,
But if it's not you I won't care.
I know of changes, but nothing would change you
To Theo the sailor who sings in his lair.
And then I'll turn and he won't be there,
Dusky black windows to light the dark stair,
Candles all gnarled in the musty air
All without flames for many's the year."
"501" "Roses are red, and violets are blue,
Primroses pale on a velvet green hue,
Warm summer days by cool waterfalls,
Like the music we hear,
Those things we'll always hold dear,
Like an old fashioned waltz.
When the moonlight shines down
On the Hollywood world,
And the heroine waits
For her beau to return,
And violins play
From behind garden walls,
How I'd love to remain
With the silver refrain
Of an old fashioned waltz.
As they dance round the floor,
And there's no-one else there,
And the world is no more
And there's never a care,
By the perfect lagoon
Where the nightingale calls,
With only the moon
And the nostalgic tune
Of an old fashioned waltz.
Roses are red and violets are blue,
Primroses pale on a velvet green hue,
Warm summer days by cool waterfalls,
Like the music we hear,
Those things we'll always hold dear,
Like an old fashioned waltz,
Like an old fashioned waltz,
An old fashioned waltz."
"502" "Here comes the morning how it pleases
It always brings me something new
Its golden light will wash away the dust of yesterday
If I try it may let me forget you
And when these winter days are over
I mean to set myself upon my feet
I see me as something that I have never been
And I'll pick up the pieces that will make the girl complete
I'll be smiling all the time at everybody
My friends will tell me I'm just not the same
I won't linger over any tragedies that were
And I won't be singing any more sad refrains"
"503" "The summer was the reason
Why it took so long to see
That even if I do possess
Some seeds of honesty,
There is no garden,
So how come I have no land?
I shall be waiting here awhile
To see what comes to hand.
Misers mise and compromise;
I know what I have seen.
The wanderers are in the east;
That's where I should have been.
But I did not go there;
I couldn't find the way.
I do believe I made a try,
But I really couldn't say.
Oh, that wretched Wilbur,
He keeps ploughing up the land.
He fights the battle thoughtfully
With roses in his hands.
But where is the fight now?
So play us your merry song.
The autumn, it has blown away,
And the winter, it is long."
"504" "One evening fair I took the air
Down by Blackwaterside
'Twas gazing all around me
When the Irish lad I spied
All through the first part of that night
We did lie in sport and play,
When this young man arose and he gathered his clothes,
Saying, \"Fare thee well today\".
That's not the promise that you gave to me
When the first you lay on my breast,
You could make me believe with your lying tongue
That the sun rose in the west.
Go home, go home, to your father's garden
Go home and weep your fill,
And think upon your own misfortune
Which you bought with your wanton will."
"505" "(Sandy Denny)
Love, oh, don't we know
How can the river flow
Without you
Warming like the sand
Upon the land
How can we doubt you?
Dark to me the night
And dim the morning light tomorrow
How can we not see
The simple melody of sorrow?
Oh, to be with you
Oh, to see them through
Those days when we think you are gone
They are so lonesome and so long
What shall we do?
Parting comes to soon
My weary tune
Has lost its pleasure
Waiting for the time
This lonely wine
Has lost its treasure
Dark to me the night
And dim the morning light tomorrow
How could I not see
The simple melody of sorrow?
Oh, to be with you
Oh, to see them through
These days when I think you are gone
They are so lonesome and so long
What shall we do?"

I've never had a proper home,
Not one like yours is.

With 'orses.

Sunday morning, there's no one in church,
But the clergy's chosen man
And he is fine I won't worry about him.
Got the book in his hand.
Oh, there's a bitter east wind, and the fields are swaying,
The crows are round their nests.
I wonder what he's in there a saying
To all those souls at rest.
I see the path which lead to the door,
And the clergy's chosen man.
Bushes and bria
You and I,
Where do we stand?
I wonder if he knows I'm here,
Watching the briars grow.
And all these people beneath my shoes,
I wonder if they know.

Knew a clergy's chosen man.

And you're no hazy maiden in grey.

And the sunshine is awaiting for another sunny day.
Breakers whisper to the shells upon the shore,
And hear the seagulls they cry for more.
And hear the gulls they cry for more.
Good day to you sweet Autumn, so gently you appear.
Why I never even realized those rustic times were near.
The moment's changing from a dusty green to gold,
The Summer fair she has grown old.
The Summer fair she has grown old.
And away in the blue of the skies and over the trees
How the carnival flies on the wings of a breeze.
You've had your time and now it's mine for me to go,
These colder days they move too slow.
These older days they move too slow.
So the Summertime is leaving, and the carnival's away,

They said that it was snowing
In astounded tones upon the news
I wonder why they're always so surprised
'Cos every year it snows
Frozen images of snowploughs
As they churn along the motorways
I haven't had no boots to wear
Or any loot to spare
For days and days
I've travelled more than forty miles today
I must have grown some wings
It's strange how time just seems to fly away
I can't remember things
In a world of my own they say
And who can blame them
They're just not the same
I've known about it all along
Though I thought I was all wrong
And it's such a shame
Why don't you have no brushes any more
I used to like your style
I see no paintings anywhere
And there's no smell of turpentine
Did it really have no meaning?
Well, I never thought I'd hear those words from you
Who needs a meaning anyway
I'd settle anyday
For a very fine view
Well, I couldn't even tell you all the changes
Since you saw me last
My dreams were like the autumn leaves
They faded and they fell so fast
In fact as you say the snows are here
And how the time it slips away
But I'm glad you did pass by
I think I'll have another try
It's another day
The day and then the night had gone
It was not long before the dawn
And the travelling one
Who sat so stiffly in the chair
Began to yawn
Having kept me here so long my friend
I hope you have a sleeping place to lend
But the painter he just smiled and said
\"I'll see you in a while\"

Oh, we're meetin' at the courthouse at eight o'clock tonight
You just walk in the door and take the first turn to the right
Be careful when you get there, we hate to be bereft
But we're taking down the names of everybody turning left
Oh, we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
Here to save our country from a communistic plot
Join the John Birch Society, help us fill the ranks
To get this movement started we need lots of tools and cranks
Now there's no one that we're certain the Kremlin doesn't touch
We think that Westbrook Pegler doth protest a bit too much
We only hail the hero from whom we got our name
We're not sure what he did but he's our hero just the same
Oh, we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
Socialism is the ism dismalest of all
Join the John Birch Society, there's so much to do
Have you heard they're serving vodka at the WCTU?
Well you've heard about the agents that we've already named
Well MPA has agents that are flauntedly unashamed
We're after Rosie Clooney, we've gotten Pinkie Lee
And the day we get Red Skelton won't that be a victory
Oh we're the John Birch Society, the John Birch Society
Norman Vincent Peale may think he's kidding us along
But the John Birch Society knows he spilled the beans
He keeps on preaching brotherhood, but we know what he means
We'll teach you how to spot 'em in the cities or the sticks

The CIA's subversive and so's the FCC
There's no one left but thee and we, and we're not sure of thee

Join the John Birch Society holding off the Reds
We'll use our hand and hearts and if we must we'll use our heads
Do you want Justice Warren for your Commissar?
Do you want Mrs. Krushchev in there with the DAR?
You cannot trust your neighbor or even next of kin
If mommie is a commie then you gotta turn her in

"591" "I Can't Help But Wonder Where I'm Bound
Chad Mitchell Trio
It's a long and a dusty road.
It's a hard and a heavy load
And the folks we meet ain't always kind.
Some are bad and some are good.
Some have done the best they could.
Some have tried to ease our troubling mind.
Chorus:
And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound.
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound.
I have traveled across this land
Just a-doing the best I can.
Tryin' to find what I was meant to do.
And the faces that I see
Are as worried as can be.
Looks like they've been wonderin', too.
Chorus
I had a buddy, way back home,
But he started out to roam
And I hear he's out by Monterey,
And sometimes, when I've had a few,
His voice comes singin' through
And I'm a-goin' out to see him some old day.
Chorus
If you see us passin' by
And you sit and you wonder why
And you wish that you were a rambler, too.
Nail your shoes to the kitchen floor,
Lace 'em up, bar the door
And thank the stars for the roof that's over you.
Chorus
And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound,
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound."
"592" "Well, they called him Super Skier
As he sat around the sun-deck,
For he swore that he would never take a spill
When they finally took him down
They had to use three toboggans
To carry all the pieces down the hill
[Chorus]
He was comin' down that slope
Goin' ninety miles an hour
When he caught an edge of his ski
Well, his clothes, they were fast,
But the slopes, they were faster
That's the last of Super Skier we shall see
Well, he hollered, \"What the hell!\"
As he put 'em parallel
He figured there was nothing else to learn
(Oh, no...)
And as he started on his way,
He was shoutin', \"Andele!\",
Assuming that he'd never have to turn.
Well, he was slippin' down that slope
Goin' ninety miles an hour
When a mogul flipped him in the air
His jumping form was fine
Until he ran into that pine,
And two one-legged skiers left from there
[Chorus]
When he left that tree at last,
He was moving twice as fast
Both halves were skimming
Moguls like a feather
He said, \"If I must be
A split personality,
How can I ever keep my knees together?\"
One ski was headed east,
And the other headed west,
'Cause both of them, you see,
Were running freer
And folks up on Little Nell
Looked up, scared as hell,
Said, \"It's a bird.\" \"No, it's a
Plane.\" \"It's Super Skier!\"
[Chorus]
Now the moral of my story
Though my story's kinda gory
Is very simple even to a dope
You buy the fastest clothes you can,
Then talk skiing like a man,
But don't let people catch you on the slope!
[Chorus]
Well he was comin' down that slope
Goin' ninety miles an hour
When he caught an edge of his ski
Well, his clothes they were fast
But the slopes, they were faster
That's the last of Super Skier we shall see
That's the last of super skier we shall see!"
"593" "by Woody Guthrie
I was born about ten thousand years ago
There ain't nuthin' in this world that I don't know
I saw Peter Paul and Moses playin' ring-around-the-roses
And I'll whup the guy what says it isn't so
Well, I'm just a lonesome traveler, a great historical bum
Highly educated through history I have come
I built the Rock of Ages, it was in the year oh one
And that's about the biggest thing that Man has ever done
I saw Adam and Eve driven from the door
I'm the guy that picked the figleaves that they wore
And from behind the bushes peepin' saw the apple they was eatin'
And I swear that I'm the one that et the core
Now I built the garden of Eden, it was in the year oh two
Joined the apple-pickers union and I always paid my dues
I'm the man that signed the contract to raise the risin' sun
And that's about the biggest thing that Man has ever done
I taught Samson how to use his mighty hand
I showed Columbus to this happy land
And for Pharaoh's little kiddies I built all the pyramiddies
And to the Sahara carried all the sand
Now I was strawboss on the pyramids and the tower of Babel too
I opened up the ocean, let the mighty children through
I fought a million battles and I never lost a one
And that's about the biggest thing that Man has ever done
I taught Solomon his little ABC's
I'm the first one to eat Limburger cheese
And while floating down the bay with Methuseleh one day
I saw his whiskers floating in the breeze
Now I fought the revolution that set this country free
It was me and a couple of Indians that dumped the Boston tea
I won the battle of Valley Forge and the battle of Bully Run
And that's about the biggest thing that Man has ever done
Now Queen Elizabeth she fell in love with me
We were married in Milwaukee secretly
But I got tired and shook her and ran off with General Hooker
To go shootin' skeeters down in Tennessee

Griselda passed him by, and the sportsmen all did holler
?Oh the gray will win the day, and Stewball, he can foller?
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win
In the middle of the track, up spoke the noble rider
?I fear we must fall back, that gray is runnin' like a tiger?
Up spoke the noble horse, \"Ride on, ride on my master
We're only half way round the course, and now we'll see who's faster?
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win
And as they did discourse, ol' Stewball flew like lightnin'
He dashed around the course, and the gray mare she was taken
Ride on, ride on, my noble horse for a good two hundred guineas
Your saddle, it shall be of gold when we pick up our winnings
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win
Well, past the winning post, bold Stewball went so handy
And both the horse and rider called for sherry, wine and brandy
They drank to that gray mare, the gallant Miss Griselda
And to all who lost their money on the sporting plains of Kildare
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win, oh, you'll win
Bet on Stewball, my boy, and you might win"

And just because her skin was brown
No wonder she has grown so fast
Those four gray walls were meant to last
The friends there that she can count upon
Take orders, but always the spirit holds
Scenes of the never-ending trend
She waits for the hours and hours to pass
She looks to the hourglass
Then four gray walls come tumbling down
And just because her skin was brown
No wonder she has grown so fast
Those four gray walls were meant to last
Those four gray walls were meant to last
As the shadows come down
She sees him leaving
She can recall
Seems that this fire has lost its form
The form of the hourglass
The four gray walls came tumbling down

lakes
One morning I did stray,
Until I reached sweet Clady banks
where the silvery salmon play,
I strolled around through old Bunbeg
and down along the shore,
And gazed with admiration
on the green fields of Gaothdobhair.
I visit Magherclocher,
On Middletown heights I stand,
Beneath me lies the ocean wide,
and Machergallon strand,
Those sandy banks so dear to me,
Those banks I do adore,
Behind me lies sweet Derrybeg
and the green fields of Gaothdobhair.The bonny Isle of Goal
and Inishmean so near,
I see the little fishing fleet
as it lies along the pier,
I wander through the graveyard
where those have gone before,
That once lived happy and content
on the green fields of Gaothdobhair.
I see sweet Inish Oirthir,
and far off Tory Isle,
I view the ocean liners
as they stream along in style,
on board are Irish emigrants
with hearts both sad and sore,
As they gazed on old Tir Chonaill hills
and the green fields of Gaothdobhair.An old song in praise of the parish from

Without a smile, so long a journey
Storm rise on the northern skyline

See for miles, the clear horizon

Translation
My darling love, will you come back home?
My darling love, will you come with me?
My darling love, will you come back home?
My darling love
He was down at the market
He drank and sang all day long
When night came and he hadn't a penny in his pocket
Oh what a shame I didn't take the missus' advice
I met him at sunrise
A charming, healthy and lively young lad
When he lifted his hat and spoke with a smile
I fell in love with him, thought it would never end
My coat had buttons of silver
And the best silk ribbons in the country
Golden chains and precious stones
I truly enticed him with my glitter and gold
No one knew from which part of the land he came
He spoke nobly and with pleasant ease
Rumor had it that there was a lord in his family
It wasn't long 'til I was engaged to him
The bond is long and difficult to untie
It's much better to be sure of it*
It didn't take long 'til he broke my heart
Indeed this is not the story I'd prefer to be telling**
But then he went back down to the market
And bought a ticket for a pound or two
Luck was on his side, he won the lottery
Now we'll forever be living the good life
*This might mean that the link to this nobleman was a very distant one, and that 'he' therefore was not rich - in fact quite poor; so she instantly regrets her engagement to him.
**\"A leoga\" means \"alas\". \"N seo mo sciln\" means \"this is not my story\" (or anecdote), and \"\", when placed after the sentence like this, can just mean \"oh\", but it can also be a term of endearment, then pertaining to \"sciln\". So the way I think it makes the most sense is if we take \"mo sciln \" to mean something like \"my sweet story\", ie., the story that she wished she were telling now."
"669" "The kingdom of stone is on the wild and distant rolling hills
Solitary land stands alone and silence fought
And look into the dark and endless skies
And hear the clouds fly the angels sigh
Sweet water cool on a world it feels like paradise
Ten spirits more lay illusion on my mind
And look into the dark and endless skies
And hear the clouds fly the angels sigh
It's strange day in the country
It's a strange day in the country"
"670" "Autumn leaves are falling 'round us
Time to gather all those many thoughts
Of all the things that might have been
Or gained at such a cost
For some of us there's endless hoping
For some of us craziness too
Holding on to better reasons
Works for me and you, you know it's true
And when the stakes are higher
Never play with fire, leave it alone
I wandered through a country churchyard
And wandered what kind of life they led
Walked into a castle ruin
Of gentry that had fled
For some of them had endless hoping
Some of them crazy too
Holding on to better reasons
We'll never truly know, oh
Those trees will tumble down on a stormy day
And those leaves will fade away, fade away
The autumn leaves are falling 'round us
I'm here to gather all my many thoughts
Of all the things that might have been
As the ground has turned to frost
Leaves are falling
Autumn leaves are falling
Leaves are falling
Autumn leaves are falling"
"671" "It was on a fine summer's morning
The birds sweetly tune on each bough
And as I walked out for my pleasure
I saw a maid milking a cow
Her voice was so enchanting, melodious
Left me quite unable to go
My heart, it was loaded with sorrow
For the pretty maid milking her cow
Then to her I made my advances
\"Good morrow most beautiful maid
Your beauty my heart so entrances\"
\"Pray sir do not banter,\" she said
\"I'm not such a rare precious jewel
That I should enamour you so
I am but a poor little milk girl,\"
Says the pretty maid milking her cow
The Indies afford no such jewel
So bright, so transparently clear
I do not add things to my funeral
Consent but to know me my dear
Oh, had I the Lamp of Aladdin
Or the wealth that gold mines can bestow
I'd rather be poor in a cottage
With the pretty girl milking her cow."

"678" "'Tis the last rose of summer
Left blooming alone.
All her lovely companions
Are faded and gone.
No flowerer of her kindred
No rosebud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes
Or give sigh for sigh.
I'll not leave thee thou lone one
To pine on the stem
Since the lovely are sleeping
Go sleep thou with them;
Thus kindly I scatter
Thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden
Lie scentless and dead.
So soon may I follow
When friendships decay
And from loves' shining circle
The gems drop away!
When true hearts lie withered
And fond ones are flown
Oh! Who would inhabit
This bleak world alone?"
"679" "Came into a dream in the night

They come alive for me and for you
Daring for love, wrestling the moment
Danger surrounds, so blue

One and one and one is three
And the man said, Hey, come and cut yourself a piece of the big time
Armor-clad forces, riding Trojan horses

I didn't want to be a part of the great debate on moonshine
Stop, pay the price, they said to me
Take this advice, you're out of your head
I said, Stop, hold the phone
This has to be cut to the bone
Too bad, I see red, I see red, I see red
Sly man stumbles, twists and he tumbles
He always lands on his feet
And he sets his face towards the far horizon
Won't you come this way? Can't you go that way?
But his rhythm don't miss a beat
'Cause he's doing everything he can to keep surviving
Stop, pay the price, they said to me
Take this advice, you're out of your head
Stop, pay the price, they said to me
Take this advice, you're out of your head
I said, Stop, hold the phone
This has to be cut to the bone
Too bad, I see red, I see red, I see red
So who wants a riot? People should be quiet
Don't we give them good TV?
You can learn to love your lifetime of distraction
Nothing on the inside, nothing on the outside
All the way from A to Z
I can live without that kind of satisfaction
Stop, pay the price, they said to me
Take this advice, you're out of your head
I said, Stop, hold the phone
This has to be cut to the bone
Too bad, I see red, I see red, I see red
Stop, pay the price, they said to me

There was me with me music walkin' down the street,
And her with her tambourine was beatin' hand and feet.

Over young green mountain the weather being dry,
We each had a bottle filled up to the top
And whenever we were getting dry we took a little drop.

Eatables of all kind and plenty of good wine,
Good bed and blankets just for we two,
And I rolled her in me arms me boys, and wouldn't you do too.

Early the next morning we arose to go our way,
I called than to the landlord to see what was to pay,
Fourteen and sixpence just for two,
Four crowns upon the table my darling then she threw.

She started off for Germany right early the next year,
But me being unwilling for to cross the raging sea,
Here's a health unto my bonny lass wherever she may be.

"696" "Brian Boru Anniversay 2014
Brian Boru, one of the greatest and coolest high kings of ireland, will have his 1000 year anniversary on Good Friday in 2014 and we're having a party to cheer him on his way.
He was the \"Ard Ri\", meaning \"High King\", so to be honest he was one of the first and most defo the last high king to unite Ireland under one monarch.
When he was eighty-nine, he gave the Vikings a good 'ol Battle at Clontarf on Good Friday, 1014 and defeated them, but didn't get to make it home himself and one of de pissed off defeated Vikings, Bothair, murdered Brian, apparently in his tent!
Ireland's coolest king was dead and gone, but
\"Brian was the last man in Erin who was a match for a hundred.\"
So fancy coming along to celebrate on the day?"

Translation
I am a boy from ireland and i'd coax a nice young girl,
I wouldn't ask for a dowry with her, i'm rich enough myself,
I own cork, big as it is both sides of the glen and tyrone,
And if i don't change my ways i'll be the heir for county mayo.
Cow herding, my leo, i did not never practice,
But playing and drinking with new young women by the mountain.
If i lost my wealth and i don't think i lost my sense,
And your kiss is no more to me than a show worn for a year.
My love and treasure, don't marry the old grey man,
But marry a young man, my leo, even though he lives but a year,
Or you'll still be without a daughter or son above you,
Crying in the afternoon or in the morning hard."

Forgotten is the race that no-one knows.

For the pretty maid milking her cow
Then to her I made my advances
\"good morrow most beautiful maid
Your beauty my heart so entrances\"

\"i'm not such a rare precious jewel
That I should enamour you so
I am but a poor little milk girl,\"

The indies afford no such jewel
So bright, so transparently clear

English Translation From Jason Carns
Down by the beach, in the deep of night
The big world is sleeping and I am alone
The sea-birds are calling sorrowfully
Like poor souls in pain
Total purity and total abundance (?)
Bliss and calmness and beauty in the world
The murmur of the sea going into my ears
The soft song of the water flowing in the river.
Above on the headland* there is a blessed old cemetery
The place in which saints lived in times long ago
There are people within spending a while carefree
The will not walk round on the shore any more.
Loneliness strikes my spirits as I look at the cemetery
And I'm thinking about the people in there sleeping
Men and young women, old people and children
People of my people and friends of my heart.
The cocks are crowing and the stars are fading
The moon is setting and it's not long until day
Goodbye now blessed old cemetery
And to the people who walked with me down by the beach.
(Above...)* A rough translation. Couldn't find the word \"inseÃ¡in\", but think
It means something like this.

Fingers touch and he plays a tune

And it shines from within
A ready pen for a picture
Fine scribes lead the way
Focus lens direct eyes that see
The gifted hands
Through timeless sands
It hides from the outside
And it shines from within
When nature takes you for a stroll
Down an avenue with so much soul
Pleasure, gifts and the ornaments
The creation found \"in the moving cloud\"
It hides from the outside
And it shines from within
The kind that keep holding on
And it shines within

Waiting adrift they cannot hold back
Cannot hold back
Tear misted eyes standing alone
A broken will over all that they?ve known

Out in the distance far is the calling
Shadows still steal
Through the place that they knew
A vision that?s empty is what they see
The eyes of tomorrow
Look to sunset dreams
Sorrow deepens only to tell
That silence speaks where words cannot mend
Words cannot mend
A vision that?s empty is what they see
The eyes of tomorrow
Look to sunset dreams

Waiting adrift they cannot hold back
Cannot hold back

From jason carns
Down by the beach, in the deep of night
The big world is sleeping and I am alone
The sea-birds are calling sorrowfully
Like poor souls in pain
Total purity and total abundance (? )
Bliss and calmness and beauty in the world
The murmur of the sea going into my ears
The soft song of the water flowing in the river.
Above on the headland* there is a blessed old cemetery
The place in which saints lived in times long ago
There are people within spending a while carefree
The will not walk round on the shore any more.
Loneliness strikes my spirits as I look at the cemetery
And I'm thinking about the people in there sleeping
Men and young women, old people and children
People of my people and friends of my heart.
The cocks are crowing and the stars are fading
The moon is setting and it's not long until day
Goodbye now blessed old cemetery
And to the people who walked with me down by the beach.
(above...)* a rough translation. couldn't find the word \"insein\", but think it means something like this."

Sell me other dreams; oh, the summer's here

Hoping we can work it out
With fate on your side, luck and some pride
You are on the right line

In fortune's hand
Where do we stand?
In fortune's hand
There isn't a noble or a humble person
Who isn't up or down a while
Throw caution to the wind
Leave your cares behind
You know we're going down the line
You know we're going down the line
Tell me what you please

And pleasent was the air
And there was non save she and i
Among the flowers fair.
In dewy grass and green we walked
She timid was and coy
How can'st thou choose but pity me
My pretty pearl, my joy
How comes it that thou stroll this way?
Sweet maiden tell me true
Before bright phoebus' glittering ray
Has supped the morning dew?
I go to tend the flocks I love
The ewes and tender lambs
That pasture by the myrtle grove
That gambol by their dams
There I enjoy a pure content
At dawning of the day
Then, hand in hand, we lovers went
To see the flock at play.
And as we wended down the road
I said to her, \"sweet maid,
Three years I in my place abode
And three more must be stayed
The three that I am bound so fast
O fairest wait for me
And when the weary years are past
Then wedded we will be.\""

Is mheall sí lena glorthaí mé.

's í ba mheallachaí 's ba mhilse póg,

Gur mheall sí lena glorthaí mé.
Shíl mé nach raibh duine bocht ar mo dhream,
Nach raibh sa tsaol seo ach spórt is greann,
Ach faraoir tá mé fágtha anois go fann, modhobhrán bhoct liom féin,
ó mheall sí lena glorthaí mé.
Is iomaí oiche fhada fhuar,
A chaith mé 'suirí leithe chois na gcruach,
Is a 'teacht 'na 'bhaile arís gan ghruaim le bodhránacht a' lae,
Nuair a mheall sí lena glorthaí mé.
Thóg sí a seotlaí I bhfad ar shiúl,
Is d'fhág sí mise a' sileadh na sul,
Nar chuma liom dá mbínn a' dúil, lena feicéail arís níos mó,
Och, mheall sí lena glorthaí mé.
Nach doiligh domhsa theacht fríd a' tsaol,
O d'eálaigh an ainnir úd a chráigh mo chroí,
Is d'fhág sí mise lag gan bhrí 'o mo chaitheamh 's 'o mo chloí,
ó mheall sí lena glorthaí mé.
Ach dá bhfáighinn-sa an saol seo ar mo mhian,
Scéal cinnte go mbeimis óg a choích',
Nó chuirfin-se lámh na cloige arís
Go dtí an t-am arbh fhiú bheith beo

Where are you going says my dear
Why are you up so early O
I've seen you on the dewy grass
Before the sower Ferdio.
Quite modestly she answered me
And she said I gathering mushrooms
To make my Mammy ketchup O.
O ketchup O
And she said I am gathering mushrooms
To make my Mammy ketchup O.

Her heart was like a feather O
And her lips on mine do gentle join
And we both sat down together O.

They come alive for me and for you
Daring for love, wrestling the moment
Danger surrounds, so blue
Weather the storm, brighter horizons

As high as the sky above
Clouds passing by
When love will find its way

Translation
[from larry keith ogle]
On the green stubble-fields of autumn
I saw you, my sweetheart.
Nice were your feet in shoes
And wonderful your nimble gait.
Your hair the color of roses
And your ringlets tightly plaited
Alas that we're not married
Or on board ship sailing away
The boys around here are
Laughing and getting bold
And the people of the high straw?
Are making ? ? of my brown girl
If the king of spain would
Go abroad with his assembled men
I would flatten grass and rank grass
And I would be with my brown girl
Buying cows at the fair
If I were ? and my brown girl
Go and come first love
Until we go over to gaoth-bearra
Until we separate from each other
The tops of the branches and the swan
From the waves ?
That won't separate us
And it's only folly for you to put it ? ?
I wrote a letter
To my sweetheart and a sharp complaint
She sent it back to me
That her heart was inside me.
Compose the artsswannoble person ?
Finer than silk or bird feathers
Heavy is my sigh
When I think of being apart from her.
What I heard on Sunday
As conversation among the women
That she was going to be married
To a young man from the place.
Sweetheart take my advice
And this autumn stay as you are
And don't tell anyone, my love,
That you are my love."
"825" "The mist has cleared from Muckish Hill
Our parting coming nearer
The last embrace, the final touch
With nothing more to say
Nothing more to say
As silence fell around the bridge
Not a single word was spoken
A bitter breeze, a lonely stream
Echoed through the Glen
Echoed through the Glen
Droichead na ndeor
Agus droichead na gcaointe
Droichead na gcaointe
Agus droichead na ndeor
Memories fade with passing age
In forlorn hope we wait for
Distant hills still haunt us now
Until the end of time
Until the end of time
Droichead na ndeor
Agus droichead na gcaointe
Droichead na gcaointe
Agus droichead na ndeor
Droichead na ndeor
Agus droichead na gcaointe
Droichead na gcaointe
Agus droichead na ndeor"
"826" "'Tis the last rose of summer
Left blooming alone.
All her lovely companions
Are faded and gone.
No flowerer of her kindred
No rosebud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes
Or give sigh for sigh.
I'll not leave thee thou lone one
To pine on the stem
Since the lovely are sleeping
Go sleep thou with them;
Thus kindly I scatter
Thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden
Lie scentless and dead.
So soon may I follow
When friendships decay
And from loves' shining circle
The gems drop away!
When true hearts lie withered
And fond ones are flown
Oh! Who would inhabit
This bleak world alone?"
"827" "At length did cross an albatross
Through the fog it came
As if it had been a Christian soul
We hailed it in God's name
It ate the food it ne'er had eat
And 'round and 'round it flew
The ice did split with a thunder fit
The helmsman steered us through
And a good south wind sprang up behind
The albatross did follow
And everyday for food or play
Came to the mariners' hollow"

Withoot a word for ony

As bleek and dour and bonny

Ayeways awa tae leave us
She's gane aa through the mountain range
Nae mair she says she'll see us"

2005 - A Method To Feel Alive
Please I feel so alive,
Forgot all thats in your eyes,
It's enough to be just unforgiving canned emotion,
Look at these things that you've said and done,
Look at all thats in your heart,
But is it enough to feel just like always (surely)
Feel as you know (feel as you know) tonight - we could be,
And its alright falling into this world for a while,
Seems like we should go (seems like we should go) tonight - we should be, New lifes so risky,
Just like to leave this all behind
It's easy to deny - to allow ourselves to fly,
Words wont let you heal because of me go find it's broken,
Look at these things that you've said and done,
Look at all thats in your heart,
Time wont make this heal,
Just like always (surely)
Feel as you know (feel as you know) tonight - we could be,
And its alright falling into this world for a while,
Seems like we should go (seems like we should go) tonight - we should be,
New lifes so risky,
Just like to leave this all behind
(Short instrumental)
Theres nothing quite like the way we always end up back where
- we begin,
Theres something that spirals so far away,
I need to just let these pictures fall away,
(Is there anything in me),
Why am I feeling this way? (I cannot..)
Feel as you know (feel as you know) tonight - we could be,
And its alright falling into this world for a while,
Seems like we should go (seems like we should go) tonight - we should be,
New lifes so risky,
Just like to leave this all behind"

So open your hands and grasp it

But things only get worse and I only meant well
At least I thought I did
Am I only the air when you need to breathe?
Am I only a window when you, when you need to see?

Who are we if not the skin that binds to our bones?
Nothing is ever safe, nothing is ever clear

Hear the whisper in my hear

We're singing songs that we've written at our own wake
It's like we're waiting for a mountain to fade
We're falling back, back into our old ways
You know who I am, I know you are
An atom bomb, a dying star
So here's one for all of you
Here's one for everything we didn't do
Too old to die young

Cornflower blue, bloomin' in the mornin' sun
Tiny flowers that grew, from when our love had just begun
Long ago we planted, each dry and dusty row
how long has it taken, for the seeds of love to grow?
Cornflower blue...
Cornflower blue, like the faded shirt you wore
Standing in the shadows, when I opened up the door
The smile in your eyes, when you said hello
Held me so tenderly, and you would not let me go
Cornflower blue...
Cornflower blue, deeper than the evenin' sky
peaceful as a river, bluer than goodbye
Blue like a diamond, when the light shines true
If love came in colors, then I'd choose this one for you
Cornflower blue...

He's just a Plastic Paddy, singin' Plastic Paddy songs
In a Plastic Paddy pub that they call The Blarny Stone
There's plastic shamrocks everywhere, there's Guinness and green beer
And a sign in gaelic above the bar which says \"God Bless All Here\"
His guitar sounds like a wardrobe, and it's out of tune at that
His singin' voice it ranges from a sharp to a flat
He's just desecrated \"The Holy Ground\", ripped apart \"Black Velvet Band\"
Sang some nights drunk and now he's sunk \"The Irish Rover\" with all hands
'Cause he's just a Plastic Paddy, singin' Plastic Paddy songs
In a Plastic Paddy pub that they call The Blarny Stone
The publican's a proddy Scot by the name of McIntyre
Who does not allow collections for the men behind the wire
He's done awful things to \"Molly Malone\" and \"The Farrows of Tralee\"
He's murdered \"Carach Fergus\" and poor old \"Mother Machree\"
He's just thrashed his way through \"Galway Bay\" and \"The Wild Irish Rose\"
And if he starts singing \"Danny Boy\", I'm gonna punch him in the nose!
He's just a Plastic Paddy, singin' Plastic Paddy songs
In a Plastic Paddy pub that they call The Blarny Stone
There's Aer Lingus posters everywhere showing pretty Irish scenes
All peaceful and idyllic, and very bloody green!
\"When Irish Eyes are Smiling\" and \"The Mountains of Mourne\"
In a central Celtic chichÃ©, the man has left no stone unturned
'Til he embarks upon the harp that once through terraced halls
Accompanying himself on the BodhrÃ¡n, which takes a lot of courage
'Cause he's just a Plastic Paddy, singin' Plastic Paddy songs
In a Plastic Paddy pub that they call The Blarny Stone
Now he's just sung in his mother tongue, \"The Ancient Irish Curse\"
And cleared the pub completely by the forty-second verse!
'Cause he's just a Plastic Paddy, singin' Plastic Paddy songs
He's started singin' \"Danny Boy\", so it's time that I was gone
And just one thought comes to my mind, as I stagger through the door
Where are you when we need you, Christy Moore?
Where are you when we need you, Christy Moore?

"893" "\"Welcome Home\"
-Eric Bogle
Now when the boys came home, Annie cried and Annie cheered
She'd been on her own for a long and lonely year
Living for his letters from far away Vietnam
And dreading the official telegram
So she was waiting at the station when his train came rolling in
She ached with anticipation of holding him again
And suddenly he was standing there in his crumpled uniform
In a heartbeat she was in his arms
Welcome home, boys, welcome home
Don't you know, you've been gone too long
Did you wonder, over there,
When you were tired, when you were scared,
If your country really cared, welcome home
When a nation goes to war, everyone's a casualty
Some are maimed and scarred, most have wounds you cannot see
So in place of the man that she had known,
Annie found instead, a sick and troubled stranger in her bed
But she was stubborn, she was lovin', so she stayed all through the years
The hard times and the drinking, the nightmares and the tears
For where hate is muddy quicksand, love is tempered steel
Annie waited for his wounds to heal
Welcome home, boys, welcome home
Don't you know, you've been gone too long
We're just so glad that you're alive
And only you will wonder why
You lived when others died, welcome home
So on a sunny Sydney morning, I heard old war drums beat
And watched the boys come marching, down the city street*
To claim their place in the nation's heart
That their blood and pain had earned
A nation that rejoiced in their return
And if the day helped to heal some wounds is a matter of debate
For some it had come none too soon, for others far too late
But I found myself hoping, as the boys went marching past
That for them the war was over, at last
Welcome home, boys, welcome home
Don't you know, you've been gone too long
What you went through in Vietnam, we can't begin to understand
But to each and every man, welcome home
Welcome home, boys, welcome home
Don't you know, you've been gone too long
May the years bring you release, as the memories decrease
May you find some kind of peace, welcome home
May you find some kind of peace, welcome home

"894" "\"The Sign\"
-Eric Bogle
In the summer of last year, in a city* far from here
That stands on the shores of the fair Pacific sea
I walked it's pleasant streets, no view in mind, no one to meet
Content to wander where my aimless feet led me
A few streets from my hotel, I passed an old stone wall
where three words had been scrawled by an unknown hand
When I read them I stopped dead, in disbelief I shook my head
For the words on that wall read, \"Free Bobby Sands\"
As the sun began to fall, and the day began to die
Thought I heard the wild geese call, from a dark and empty sky
For long minutes I stood there, in that busy thoroughfare
While the past rose sharp and clear in my mind's eye
I saw it all again, the passion, hate, and pain
the indifference and the shame as a young man died
But it was all so long ago, and who now cares or knows
why Bobby Sands chose his lonely death?
But to the one who wrote that sign,
it seems that Bobby's light still shines
The words rang from another time,
but the paint was fresh
As the sun began to fall, and the day began to die
Thought I heard the wild geese call, from a dark and empty sky
So I went down to the sea, to let it's wild song comfort me
But my thoughts would not let me be, and unchecked they ran
Through my future, present, and past,
not for the first time nor the last
I heard them ask, \"Could you be the kind of man
who would gladly sacrifice everything, even life
and put no price on a cause, or an ideal?\"
No answer echoed in my heart, so I turned and I walked back
through the twilight's deepening dark, to my hotel.
****************
Historical Note:
Bobby Sands, MP, was imprisoned in 1981 under criminal charges
stemming from his alleged involvement in IRA terrorist activities
in Ulster Province (Northern Ireland). Mr. Sands, along with
20 other alleged IRA members in prison awaiting trial, went
on a hunger strike to protest inhumane conditions in the prison, and to
have the IRA members reclassified as \"political prisoners\".
The hunger strike lasted more than 60 days, resulting in the deaths
of many of the prisoners, of which Mr. Sands was the first to succumb.

"895" "\"MIRRORS\"
-Eric Bogle
Children are born with trust in their eyes
It's the first thing that we betray
Children are born believing in magic
It's the first thing we take away
Fill them with doubt instead of magic
And fear instead of trust
And after awhile, they're just like us
On this earth there is a city
In a rich green pleasant country
Where they kill their children
The children of the streets
Free enterprise extermination
Why waste rehabilitation?
A bullet is forever
It's so final quick and cheap
And the despots all wear policemen's badges
Kill to supplement their wages
Earn their bloody bounty
With the gun and the club and knife
While profit-conscious businessmen
Upright solid citizens
Pay them a cew cruzeiros
For every murdered street kids life
(But they're children!)
They're garbage on the streets
(Oh the children!)
They're beggars, whores and thieves
(Oh pity the children!)
Cry pity if you will,
There's none on the streets
Of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil
To bless this piece of paradise
High on a hill stands Jesus Christ
Gazing down with sightless eyes
At the daily blasphemy
A mocking marble coontradiction
Arms spread wide in benediction
Suffer the little children,
Suffer them to come to me
And the despots cry \"amen, amen\"
While they bow their knees to Bethlehem
They spit in the face of humankind
Turn our dreams to worthless dust
And the future, as it's always done,
Stares down the barrel of a gun
Which once more begs the question,
When will the despots come for us?
(But they're children!)
Have you seen their eyes?
(Oh the children!)
Hard and wary and street-wise
(Oh pity the children!)
There are no children here
Only old eyes full of hunger
And hate and hopeless fear
(But they're children!)
Abandoned and forsaken
(Oh the children!)
Useless human flotsam
(Oh pity the children!)
And pity us as well
For in our children's' eyes
We see mirrors of ourselves"

NOTES:
ANZAC:
The combined Australia/New Zealand armies that fought in both World Wars
\"Banjo\" Patterson:
Author of \"The Man From Snowy River\" and \"Waltzing Matilda\"
Billabong:
A watering hole, specifically the curved meander of a winding stream
that has been isolated due to sand bar deposition
Swagman:
I believe in the US you refer to them as \"hobos\", though a swaggy is not
always someone financially down on their luck or On The Run. Some
swagmen are just fed up with city life and want to spend their time
exploring the country on foot, living off the land and the charity of
passers-by as best they can.
Coolibah tree:
The Eucalyptus Coolibah is a species of Eucalyptus tree commonly found
in inland parts of the Australian continent.
Billy:
A billy is a tin, often an old used fruit tin or other steel container,
used to boil water to make tea. Often they have a piece of wire
across their top used as a handle, whereupon after the water is boiling,
one holds the wire, places the desired amount of tea leaves in said
water, stands up, and swings the whole billy in a circular motion
vigorously in order to force the tea leaves to the bottom of the tin. A
rather nice touch is to crush a Coolibah leaf into the water too, giving
the tea a hint of eucalyptus.
Jumbuck;
A sheep (usually refers to a ram)
Tucker-bag;
A knapsack. \"Tucker\" means \"food\".
Squatter:
In Australia in the 19th century, large swathes of outback land were
divided up and mostly allocated to \"squatters\" - often wealthy
land-owners from Britain, who could afford the prices the government was
asking. There were also freehold selections free for the taking (all you
had to do was sign on the dotted line) made available to anyone who
would try to exploit the land, but the freehold lots tended to be poorer
land where it was a battle to earn to living. Squatters became fairly
wealthy from their allocations even taking over freehold selections in
the process of expanding their lots, reflected in the fact that this one
is riding on his thoroughbred horse.
Troopers:
The troopers are law enforcement. The squatter would have called
them in because the swagman has stolen a sheep from the squatter's property.
Matilda:
Given the lonely life of a swaggy, they tend to become quite
affectionate for things that are fairly important to their immediate
existence. In this case, AIUI \"Matilda\" is the swagman's sleeping gear -
typically a bedroll.
Cockie:
Small time family farmer/rancher in rural Australia, usually on marginal land"

I've sailed the North Atlantic with ice flows in the breeze
I've sailed the Dutch East Indies o'er the calm blue sunny seas
When I think of missing seamen me heart returns again
To a season spent in Moretan Bay with Queensland Whaling Men.
Yo-ho you Queensland Whalers, you've cut the sugar cane
You've driven herds of cattle o'er the dry and dusty plain
You've dug the ore at Isa, laid countless miles of rail
And now you've come to Moreton Bay to catch a Humpback Whale
To men who've chased the brumbies, caught bullocks by the tail
It really is no problem to catch a humpback whale
You steer your iron sea-horse, poke your gun through the rigging struts
And when she runs through the coral scrub, you belt her in the guts
Yo-ho you Queensland Whalers, you've cut the sugar cane
You've driven herds of cattle o'er the dry and dusty plain
You've dug the ore at Isa, laid countless miles of rail
And now you've come to Moreton Bay to catch a Humpback Whale
Now men up in the crows nest, so whaling legends go
When they spy a humpback whale they yell out \"Thar She Blows!\"
But here in sunny Queensland you'll often hear them shout
\"There goes a bloody beauty mate, so get yer finger out!\"
Yo-ho you Queensland Whalers, you've cut the sugar cane
You've driven herds of cattle o'er the dry and dusty plain
You've dug the ore at Isa, laid countless miles of rail
And now you've come to Moreton Bay to catch a Humpback Whale
From Moreton to Caloundra, bronze whaler sharks abound
They wait like dingoes in the scrub for a wounded beast that's down
But but for all their bloody savagery, well they just can't compare
With the big bite that the tax man takes when he gets hold of your share!
Yo-ho you Queensland Whalers, you've cut the sugar cane
You've driven herds of cattle o'er the dry and dusty plain
You've dug the ore at Isa, laid countless miles of rail
And now you've come to Moreton Bay to catch a Humpback Whale
And when the season's over, we'll head for Brisbane Town
And in the nearest boozer our sorrows we will drown
With beer and firey whiskey and when we've had enough
We'll steer a steady zig zag course and never give a stuff!
Yo-ho you Queensland Whalers, you've cut the sugar cane

Now when I was a young man, I carried me pack, and I lived the free life of a rover
From the Murray's green basin to the dusty outback, well, I waltzed my Matilda all over.
Then in 1915, my country said son, It's time you stopped rambling, there's work to be done.
So they gave me a tin hat, and they gave me a gun, and they marched me away to the war.
And the band played Waltzing Matilda, as the ship pulled away from the quay
And amidst all the cheers, the flag-waving and tears, we sailed off for Gallipoli
And how well I remember that terrible day, how our blood stained the sand and the water
And of how in that hell that they called Suvla Bay, we were butchered like lambs at the slaughter.
Johnny Turk he was waiting, he'd primed himself well. He shower'd us with bullets,
And he rained us with shell. And in five minutes flat, he'd blown us all to hell
Nearly blew us right back to Australia.
But the band played Waltzing Matilda, when we stopped to bury our slain.
We buried ours, and the Turks buried theirs, then we started all over again.
And those that were left, well we tried to survive, in that mad world of blood, death and fire
And for ten weary weeks, I kept myself alive, though around me the corpses piled higher
Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over head, and when I woke up in my hospital bed,
And saw what it had done, well I wished I was dead. Never knew there was worse things than dyin'.
For I'll go no more waltzing Matilda, all around the green bush far and free
To hump tent and pegs, a man needs both legs-no more waltzing Matilda for me.
So they gathered the crippled, the wounded, the maimed, and they shipped us back home to Australia.
The legless, the armless, the blind, the insane, those proud wounded heroes of Suvla
And as our ship pulled into Circular Quay, I looked at the place where me legs used to be.
And thanked Christ there was nobody waiting for me, to grieve, to mourn, and to pity.
But the band played Waltzing Matilda, as they carried us down the gangway.
But nobody cheered, they just stood and stared, then they turned all their faces away
And so now every April, I sit on me porch, and I watch the parades pass before me.
And I see my old comrades, how proudly they march, reviving old dreams of past glories
And the old men march slowly, old bones stiff and sore. They're tired old heroes from a forgotten war
And the young people ask, what are they marching for? And I ask myself the same question.
But the band plays Waltzing Matilda, and the old men still answer the call,
But as year follows year, more old men disappear. Someday no one will march there at all.
Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda, who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?
And their ghosts may be heard as they march by that billabong, who'll come a-waltzing Matilda with me?

Historical Note:
The Gallipoli Campaign (April 25, 1915-January 8, 1916),
A major land and sea operation of World War I, in which
British, French, Australian, and New Zealand forces
Unsuccessfully attempted an invasion of Turkey.
The action was confined to the Dardanelles Strait
And the tip of the Gallipoli (Gelibolu) Peninsula near
Istanbul. The purpose of the campaign, devised by British
Munitions minister David Lloyd George, first lord of the
Admiralty Winston Churchill, General Herbert H. Kitchener,
And Admiral Sackville H. Carden, was to open up a new
Theater of war as an alternative to the stalemate in
France, to relieve Turkish pressure on Russian forces
In the Caucasus, and, by gaining control of Istanbul
And the straits, to provide a direct link with Russia
Via the Black Sea. This campaign is also significant
For Australians in that it marked the first time a major
Australian military force was commanded by Australian,
Instead of English, officers.
What initially was to be exclusively a naval operation
Failed in February 1915 when several British and French
Ships were damaged by floating mines. A land invasion was
Then decided on, but it was not begun until late April.
An amphibious landing at that time was met with heavy
Resistance by the Turks. Excessive caution and timorous
Leadership by the British commander, Sir Ian Hamilton,
Resulted in several lost initiatives. Little headway
Was made beyond the several beachheads. In early August,
After three months of stalemate and stagnation on the
Beaches, a new major offensive was begun. Once again,
However, the excessive caution and indifferent leadership
Of the British command offset the effect of heavy
Reinforcements. The Turkish forces, on the other hand, were
Inspired by the leadership of Mustafa Kemal (Kemal AtatÃ¼rk,
Later president of Turkey) and the skill of their German
Commander, Otto Liman von Sanders. After a few more months
Of stalemate, Hamilton was replaced by Sir Charles Monro,
Who was sent to evaluate the situation. Monro recommended
Evacuation, and the allied forces were withdrawn in December
And January. British casualties were 205,000 out of 410,000;
The French sustained a rate of 47,000 out of 79,000; Turkish,
250,000 to 300,000 out of 500,000. The fiasco badly
Stained the reputations of Churchill, Hamilton, and Kitchener.
Despite its overall failure, however, the Gallipoli campaign
Weakened the Turks enough to facilitate the British seizure
Of Palestine in 1917. The action also distracted the Germans
From a plan they had in 1915 to begin another offensive in France."
"899" "\"Ibrahim\"
-Eric Bogle
(Album: The Colour of Dreams)
Hey Ibrahim, tell me what do you think of Australia?
Do our beautiful desert sunsets fill you with wonder?
As the sky catches fire, and the trees and the mountains change colour
But I guess the view from this side of the barbed-wire's much better
So Ibrahim, can you tell me, why did you come here?
What dream were you chasing and what did you hope to find here?
Did you flee from your own native land because your life was in danger?
Or were the reasons much more mundane, just poverty and hunger?
Wrong path, wrong choice, wrong creed, wrong culture
Wrong place, wrong time, wrong dream and wrong colour
You see Ibrahim, there's something I've been meaning to tell you
Being hungry and poor bestows no special status upon you
We won't send you back, if you can prove they'd imprison or kill you
But if you're just going back home to starve, I'm afraid we can't help you
You see Ibrahim, you've become a bit of a problem
This world's full of refugees fleeing poverty, war and oppression
So to take in queue-jumpers like you, well it's out of the question
It would give the world's hungry and poor the wrong impression
Wrong path, wrong choice, wrong creed, wrong culture
Wrong place, wrong time, wrong dream and wrong colour
I'm afraid Ibrahim, it's time to be totally candid
You had Buckley's chance* right from the moment you landed
Already to many a threat and a danger you were branded
And all because you follow the prophet Mohammed
You didn't count Ibrahim, on political opportunism
Our leaders knew that to many Australians, the very word \"Muslim\"
Meant Al-Quaeda, Hammas, the Taliban, and terrorism
And that's why you and your family are locked up in prison.
Wrong path, wrong choice, wrong creed, wrong culture
Wrong place, wrong time, wrong dream and wrong colour
So Ibrahim, tell me what do you think of Australia?
Do our beautiful desert sunsets fill you with wonder?
As the sky catches fire, and the trees and the mountains change colour
But I guess the view from this side of the barbed-wire's much better
Yes I guess the view from this side of the barbed-wire's much better

"900" "\"NOW I'M EASY\"
- Eric Bogle
For nearly sixty years, I've been a Cockie
Of droughts and fires and floods I've lived through plenty
This country's dust and mud have seen my tears and blood
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy
I married a fine girl when I was twenty
But she died in giving birth when she was thirty
No flying doctor then, just a gentle old black 'gin
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy
She left me with two sons and a daughter
On a bone-dry farm whose soil cried out for water
So my care was rough and ready, but they grew up fine and steady
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy
My daughter married young, and went her own way
My sons lie buried by the Burma Railway
So on this land I've made me home, I've carried on alone
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy
City folks these days despise the Cockie
Say with subsidies and dole, we've had it easy
But there's no drought or starving stock on a sewered suburban block
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy
For nearly sixty years, I've been a Cockie
Of droughts and fires and floods, I've lived through plenty
This country's dust and mud, have seen my tears and blood
But it's nearly over now, and now I'm easy
And now I'm easy

"901" "\"SOMETHING OF VALUE\"
-Eric Bogle
I can see the Southern Cross tonight
While here below, bathed in it's light
The Dreamtime land safe, snug and tight is sleeping
Wrapped in complacency and contentedness
No discordant sounds disturb our rest
While the gentle souls we've dispossesed are weeping
We took it all by the gun and the sword
By the right of our race and in the name of our God
Though as outcasts ourselves, transported, condemned
None knew better than we the injustice of men
We took it all in our hunger and need
Enslaved by our past and consumed by our greed
And left them to beg for the scraps at our door
While we called them drunkards and wasters and whores
They've been drowning, drowning in their tears
For the last two hundread years
From England's New Jerusalem
To the Dreamtime land the tall ships came
With human cattle in convict chains to bind them
In the grim fight just to stay alive
Dreams must struggle to survive
Few could see the glitt'ring prize before them
We had it all in the palm of our hand
A new hope, a new dream, a new life, a new land
One last chance to break from the chains of the past
To build something of value, build something to last
This ancient land was a vast empty page
Waiting for the great writers of a brand new age
The future was ours to protect or profane
A paradise lost, a paradise gained
Now tell me, is paradise here,
After two hundred years?
So now, beneath the Southern Cross
It's time to tally up the cost
Of what we've gained and what we've lost forever
Though much has gone we can't replace
Those of us who love this place
Together now, must turn and face the future
So here's to us all, we're frail humankind
Who wander through life mostly helpless and blind
To our courage and cowardice, our humor and pain
Our hundred steps forward, ninety-nine back again
Yes here's to us all, the wise and the fools
The indifferent, the caring, the kind and the cruel
As we march to the beat of an uncertain drum
Stumbling towards what we may yet become
Towards the brave new frontiers,
Of the next two hundred years"
"902" "WEE DARK ENGINE ROOM
(G) C G7 C G / G C F G7 C / C G7 C F C G C G / C F C F C
In that wee dark engine room,
Where the chill seeps through your soul,
How we huddled round that wee pot stove
That burned oily rags and coal.
C F C G7 G /
How the winter blizzards blow, and the whaling fleet's at rest,
Tucked in Leigh harbor's sheltered bay, safely anchored ten abreast.
The whalers at their stations, as from she'd to she'd they go,
Carry little bags of coal with them, and a little iron stove.
CHORUS
The fireman Paddy worked with me on the engine stiff and cold.
A stranger to the truth was he - there's not a lie he hasn't told.
And he boasted of his gold mine, and of all the hearts he'd won,
And his bonny sense of humor shone just like a ray of sun.
CHORUS
Then one day we saw the sun and factory ships' return.
Meet your old friends, sing a song; hope the season won't be long,
Then homeward bound when it's over; we'll leave this icy hold,
But I always will remember that little iron stove.
CHORUS

\"Many songs are sung about whaling and whalers. Almost all describe
A voyage, or the catch of the whale, or some of the men and their
Needs. This song, written by Eric Bogle, describes the bone-
Chilling existance of the men who stayed with the ships when they
Were laid up for the winter, doing routine maintenance and engine
Overhaul in the clammy, unheated holds of the engine rooms.\" -ET

"903" "They'll be wondering how this all came about
And silly rumors will fly around this little town
But I don't care, I know it's in the air
How much I adore you
I've been singing about water
Without a second foot on dry ground
You make swimming so easy I'm gonna drown
In your capping blues and greens
I mean who gets to feel this way
But it's a quiet revolution in the way that you love me
You set the sky high above me
And the heart can travel given the right set of wings
You can see everything
It's a quick turn the corner back into prolific
You take the summer off jotting things down
That you hope will come back to ya
It's ain't easy when you're the only thing that's on my mind
It's the kindest storm blowing in a bigger love"
"904" "I had first realized the shape I was in
After six years in uniform, in the standing din
I signed in at eighteen for a college degree
Recruiting out of high school into opportunity
I'd always equated my love for my land
With the loyalty of the army but now I understand
I'm from a small town, I knew quiet streets
There was a market where people often meet
I built my home there, me and my family
These are the loneliest days I've seen
My soldiers are marching according to rank
They have occupied the borderlines outside the West Bank
I'm relieving my attention on a bloody red machine
A conscientious citizen for the democratic regime
This kind of struggle's not one to go alone
So I'm joining the opposition but I'm never going home"
"905" "I always wonder where you came from
And you always say Mars
I noticed one day my life was missing something
And then there you are
In your shiny Martian suit
With a ship by your side
I was wearing my heart on my sleeve
You were wearing a star
I can't help but feel the luckiest
Of anyone here
Was it so beautiful on your planet
That you wanted me there
Before you know it
We're in it one year deep
Tell me why do you want
To go out living in disguise?
You always show me love with open arms
And I always give in
I would have charmed you back from China
Or from the Pisces fin
And how I am swept away
By your mission to change the world
And I know that you've changed
One world here for sure
Before you know it
We're in it two years deep
And I know that you've changed
One world here for sure"
"906" "Yesterday the circus left town in a suitcase
Rimmed with little key chain hearts
And they tore those giant tents down
Lions in the pouring rain
And the birds in the pouring rain
Ohm but my heart belongs to the bearded woman
Who had a glory bound lonely gaze
She used to fit her head
Inside an elephant's mouth
With some kind of solitude grace
When you find it, oh you better use it up
You better hold on to it
Like it's an answer to your prayers
Spring is coming early this year, you can tell
'Cause everybody's got their old jobs back
No one stays too long around here
They left circles in the wide back fields
And the farmers tried to cover up the scars
You can still run your hands over soft black earth
And wonder where they are
Oh but my son left for the fields today
He's a fourth generation
Works good with his hands
Got his mother's cheeks and a big brass heart
And boy he loves to work that land
Out on the streets in my new city
You can see where shadows
Make prints on the pavement
They know when the Salvation Army truck
Comes around
Lions in the pouring rain
And they're birds in the pouring rain
They hold their cups
Out by the side of the circus tent doors
Between the bank and the HMV
But you never hear
The rattle on a rich man's coat
Who's got it locked up with a key"
"907" "Close the curtains and lock the doors
Shut down my day I won't answer anymore
I've got things on my mind and troubles to bare
Love is cruel, love is kind and it's everywhere
You found me overwhelmed
And clinging to my knees
You may not know it babe
But you've been helping me
I've been in deep waters
Searching for some change
I've got dreams like the weather
And habits just as strange
Oh, oh, oh
You don't find it in writing
When the heart does so much talking
That the dialogs becomes a way of rhyme
We could go on weighing
Our peace in good measures
We still would have run out of time
So don't weigh your body down
If you wanna shout it out loud
I will be your ears
And I would tell you I'm so proud
Of our love up to the last
How it all flipped by so fast
Give us both chance to rise
After a fall like this
Oh, oh, oh
I wish you all that you could wish for
All that you can hold
But this love is deeper waters
To no mold
Open your arms again in time
You will find comfort there
Love is cruel, love is kind
And it's everywhere"
"908" "The plot gets thicker and it always goes astray
You're never holding in your hands a particular play
You're not satisfied with the taste or smell
And it's not what you ordered, well
There's a good chance some body else has got it made
Well, there's trouble where you seek it
You see it in store windows
And the box is twice as big as the item
There's a spotlight shining from the corner both night and day
Some gather round and paw the glass
Others who know better pass
And they whisper to themselves, they'll never find their way
With stars in their eyes, they'll never find their way
There's trouble where you seek it
You don't have to go sneaking around
To find they've found you out by now
There's trouble where you seek it"
"909" "Deep love, hell you know trouble so well
You don't have a pattern and you never can tell
You are a yellow caution light and a yield sign
And I'm building tall fences to protect this heart of mine
Was it so much difficulty cutting that glass?
You didn't think it would last
And after twenty-two years
I'm not doing so bad at all
I guess it don't matter if the joke's on me
You have me at your beck and call
And to tell you the truth
I really don't mind at all
Change, change, change
There's a different address every time
And I've got plenty of practice
And I know you don't mind
I'm home in the country or here in the park
I stumble where ever you land
Have mercy on my timing, it's out of my hands
You want the world on a whim and the sky below
You really walk the line
But I bet you miss it when every thing's fine
I guess it don't matter if the joke's on me
You have me at your beck and call
And to tell you the truth, I really don't mind at all
What would I ever do if you left me here alone?
I would need a come back to a dial tone"
"910" "I could not stay sleeping, oh, my mind would not allow
And suddenly all these thoughts on life crept into me somehow
The sun has barely risen to lay aside another night
And it's here I settle softly into every word I write
Maybe I'm just counting up my sheep too late
But I just let them run beyond the fence
What good are guards that wouldn't give such pleasure?
I think I'll have a morning, one that starts out with a laugh
In the hopes that it would spread out equal on behalf
Of an unforgiving measure, oh where find time just ticks away
To let the simple things bring you closer in a simple way"
"911" "What kind of move is the best thing
For leaving you in the I don't know
You can leave the best of a cool nest
But there's no master plan when you go
You hear the swearing and the laughter
Smoke coming in from the neighbors next door
My Christina had the toughest set of lungs
She could out sing anyone
She'd have them up on the small floor dancing
Anyone knew anyone
I hate to be leaving in the middle of this
What can I say but
This city is chorded there's rhythm in the traffic
Spokes in the wheels wherever you go
I'm just one exception to be sitting here
Trying to carve out some kind of a home
Everyone around here lets their cats loose
To control the mice
It's the kind of neighborhood with a few broken down houses
But it's kinda nice
Going through photos of places you've been
The places you part
It's the packing and the moving that really holds on
To the rungs of a lonely heart
Just when you think it's over
Something new begins
Somewhere in the grander scheme of scheming
Just when you think you're stepping out
That's when you're stepping in
It leaves you open windowed and ever dreaming"
"912" "Bring down the rain bring out the ghosts
It's twenty-five degrees out on the West Coast
Every thing's in bloom there and I don't care
I've been thinking about leaving too
You pack as little as you can 'cause that's what you do
You put everything in storage and give the dog to mom
She wouldn't mind there's a big back field
A long time ago they stopped turning yield
You should see the view there from up on the hill
I fell in love with the train last week and everyone there
I got the scent of everyone's laughter in my hair
We watched the landscapes click by hell I was the engineer
I saw the country from the dome car and I was outta here
By night we traveled slow, by day we went fast
And no one checked to see where we were on the map
You knew you hit the prairies and you knew why
You take a deep breath and hold it in
And every deep breath seems to quiet the din
You forget about the time zones, there are none out there
Home for the reckless home for the race
It's home for a moment of time and space
You lose all your sleep when the playing is done
You learn the rails and you're learning on the tracks
Someone tells a story of an old steam back
And a village comes together seven coaches long"

Nu surrar bin, och fÃ¥glar sjunger Ã¶verallt.

HÃ¤r Ã¤r det risigt och fÃ¶rvuxet, fult och snÃ¥rigt

Kom in och slÃ¥ dig ner en stund sÃ¥ fÃ¥r vi prata!
Jag bara stammade, nu minns jag inte vad...

Oh but lately

I've been growing
I've been changing
And seems like you're barely moving

There is nothing we can do to get past this
Nothing you could say
Baby please don't fret
Our time has moved passed us
I love you
You love me
Is it possible we love differently
You need me but I need to
Feel strong baby without you

Fade away forget everything, Fade away forget everything.
My mind wants to play life seems meaningless I must say and I know its wrong to feel this way for so damn long. You can numb my brain if you can cure my pain. Afraid to lose don't wanna fight I just might.
Fade away forget everything, fade away forget everything.
But you might see what lies within me and you might believe that all is meant to be. Why, why should you and I
Fade away forget everything, fade away forget everything."

Now you're gone you've slipped away
In my life I would have given every breath to you
Did you care for me did you love me too?
Have mercy on me, Have mercy on me
Time will be the day maybe then my fear of dismay
will go away it wont last long, and when I see your face when its my time to go will you wait beside the gate to hold me, and yes i know yes you know It hurts me.

Iv been waiting for the sun to shine to pull back on me, and to you I will never say goodbye you'll be with me forever by my side.

And I take every chance I can
But she turns my world upside down

In a whirlwind when she's around
And I'm on the floor
Looking at the ceiling
And it makes me think
But I like the feeling
I found what you all are after
And I know I'm a wanted man

Reach for me when the gold starts to rust
When your colours run, will you call?
Reach for me when the threads come undone
When your cover slips and you fall
Will you reach for me?
When your glass is dry and you're out of luck
And there's no respite you can see
If that great big house with so many rooms
Is a useless thing you don't need"
"922" "When the day breaks and falls apart
That's my fanfare, my calling card
A run of bad luck, darkness at noon
I don't need the password to get to you
I'm a Venus Hunter
From another world
Ten thousand years
Since I've seen a girl
Burning petrol in my brain
What I called love you call insane
Some try wishing upon a star
Some try running, they don't get far
I'm a Venus Hunter
From another world
Ten thousand years
Since I've seen a girl"
"923" "Hold it tight
If you can
One little slip
And it's gone
From your hands
She gave in silver
But I offered her
Mercury
That last drop
How it shines
Cold to the lips
But it won't
Taste like wine
She gave in silver
But I offered her
Mercury"
"924" "Listen
To the voice that calls
From the edge of sleep
Down the hall
No breath, no lying lips
No heartbeat, no fingertips
She's invisible
Does not exist
Anymore
She's invisible
Crossed off my list
A closed door
Nothing
Breaks the silence
All the waiting hours
Of the night
No sight, no sound or shape
But imagination
Incinerates
Invisible
She's invisible
Look out"
"925" "Sun is gone, moon is a halo
Candle stars flicker and fade
In the dark, we're getting closer
Feel the world falling away
Transport of delight
Drive me out of my mind
Transport of delight
Don't look back
Leave this world behind
Branches reach up to the heavens
Shadows dance on your pale curves
I'm going down to the oasis
Start again when I return
Don't look back
Come on, now
Hold on tight
Leave this world behind"
"926" "Struck by the sight
I suppose I was hypnotized
I took a hint
And built it all up in my mind
I thought we were dealing
In diamonds and pearls
Now the sparkle is gone
And the outline is blurred
Ice sculpture melts
But I won't forget you, girl
I looked at my watch
Then I looked in your eyes
Some vague design
Started to crystallize
I thought that we had
All the time in the world
But the colours have run
And the weather has turned
Ice sculpture melts
But I won't forget you, girl"
"927" "Can't tell the end from the start
But I know how it will be
I'm gonna hijack your heart
You'll belong to me
The furthest thing from your mind
But you can't see what I see
Sugar, I prophesy
You will turn to me, yeah
So you think you're immune?
Well, you believe what you please
'Cause when I call the tune
You will never be free
You'll belong to me"
"928" "I must have had a nightmare
'Cause I'm not seeing straight
The shadows creep and slide
The strangest thoughts
Go through my head
Outside the traffic lights
They change from green to red
And as my heart applies the brakes
I reach across the bed
I was in a dream
You were by my side
Warmer than the sun
Then the picture changed
Began to fade away
Turned and you were gone
Sleepwalking
Could that be somebody
Standing on the stairs?
I can't ask you
I can't find you anywhere
So why are you out walking
Walking in my sleep?
And what goes through your mind
Each time you lie between the sheets?"
"929" "When I sunk
Into the sea
When you saw
What I did to me
Like I could fall to my knees
And worry about everything
It might hurt
But I'll be
On my way to better things
You don't want
What I need
The veil lifts my prophecy
A beautiful woman
Beautiful woman
You're the one I wanna be
A beautiful woman
Beautiful woman
You're the one I wanna see
Well you're a beautiful woman
A beautiful woman
The one with ruby seams
Beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman, beautiful woman
And in a blur
There seemed to be
Only downward
Plummeting
To the blackness of my e-
Go crushed from reality
And even though
I know these things
The forces still arrested me
Threw me down
Made me think
I'll never be
A beautiful woman
Beautiful woman
You're the one I wanna be
A beautiful woman
Beautiful woman
You're the one I wanna see
Well you're a beautiful woman
A beautiful woman
The one with ruby seams
Beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Under the water lies the core
The mother that births what comes to shore
Steeped in the womb until it's born
The boiling fire creates the storm
A beautiful woman
Beautiful woman
You're the one I wanna be
A beautiful woman
Beautiful woman
You're the one I wanna see
Well you're a beautiful woman
A beautiful woman
The one with ruby seams
Beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman, beautiful woman"

You'll be enticed by the surreal
The things she'll show you in that world
Will be the things that you can't erase
If you tried
Believe me I tried
Take my word
You're better off
Never knowing the upside of weightlessness
I must admit when she leaves
You'd follow her straight into hell

I know it's not what we planned
But I had to take a chance

Let the kerosene spill
Soak the lighthouse floor
I know it's not an answer
And I know it's not a cure
I try to get to shore
I hope the moon will keep his promises
And get me back to land
This time as I float away
There won't be one more chance
There's always one more chance

"939" "A sailor at sea for years
With weathered skin, an untamed beard
Somewhere hidden within he had a secret, he couldn't swim
Suddenly pulled overboard 50 yards from shore
A belt of lead around his waist pulled him to the floor
This sailor he won't flail his chest is filled with pride
In this life I can't swim, but soon I'm gonna fly
I'd rather drown tonight than let them know that I can't swim
That's what he said as he sunk to the bottom
Now his secret is safe at the bottom of the sea
Buried just like treasure that's where it will be
It's a treasure no man wants or ever will seek
His secret is safe with me
I'd rather drown tonight than let them know that I can't swim
That's what he said as he sunk to the bottom
I'd rather drown tonight (I'd rather drown tonight)
Than let them know that I can't swim (I'd rather drown tonight)
That's what he said (I'd rather drown tonight)

Rather drown tonight than let them know that I can't swim

That everything is okay
Then after we'll pretend that I am:

I've grown a taste for apathy
A last attempt at sanity
So forgive me

Lost inside my head
Because I sold my soul for cheap
In exchange for empty promises
They've all been broken

How can I turn this all around?
How can I turn it inside out?
Will I ever be okay?
How can I turn this all around?
How can I turn it inside out?
A shot in the dark is all I have
If I am what you say
Take what's left and run away
And if i am what you say
Then why are you still here? Run away
If i am what you say
Take what's left and run away

Maybe I was made to leave my mark on this planet
Losing it all in the process"

Hoping she could hold on
She couldn't hold on
She's a shadow at the foot of my bed
Leaving puddles from the tears that she shed
She's a shadow at the foot of my bed
She can't be real

And now you're struggling to fit me in the plot
Holding me up to these expectations
She's holding you up but her arms can't take it
Remember when it was a game?
I never wanted anything

Take a look, I guarantee you'll decide this is wrong

Change the subject, crack a smile
While the children all end up dead

Overlooking the signs, overlooking the signs
As we all fall, one by one
I will never pretend, I will never pretend that all this shit isn't happening
God knows that this is not our fault
A little girl screams in horror
His blood trickles down her face
Innocence fades out through her eyes, she's been wronged
Caught in a daze of blinding denial
\"This is only in my head\"
Change the subject, crack a smile
Can't you see that there is something wrong?

Ride out, right now
Ride out, right now

The stained glass is fucking shattered

"945" "I'll be the spark that ignites a flame
Wilderness that you try and tame
I'll be the first to tell you that I don't care (I don't care)
Inviting eyes and a dashing smile
Are just enough to hide away the demon that I've turned into
In a pact that I can't back out of
Dialogues in a parking lot
Sharpened words tearing through your sanity
They're ripping through your sanity
And we're riding scars now
[Pre-Chorus]
Caught in between
What I love and what I need
Caught in between
This is what I need"

Dark just like the sky
the raindrops hit the window sill
so leave me here tonight
Leave me by myself
with all my imperfections
Running through my head
everything I wished I was
Running through my head
Forget about the sun
tonight the world revolves around you
I could swear your frown
Pulled the clouds down from the sky
Created this fog tonight
And on the car ride home
You retreated to your head
A thousand words I should have said
Running through my head
But we just stared at the road
Running through my head
And you just cried
Forget about the sun
tonight the world revolves around you"
"947" "This is what I wanted
A chance for a better life than this
A life that I can't get if I'm stuck here on dry land
And when we're on the open sea
I'll take my secrets write them down for you to see
Tear them to shreds and then I'll throw them overboard
I'll watch my words fade into the tide
When the anchor drops for the last time I'll be free
And I know that I'll be miserable
When the hurricanes become unbearable
And when the lines get tangled up
And the nets are torn apart
Having turned into the wind
And the crashing waves they knock me from my feet
I hope you'll remember me
When this boy becomes a man
If I never make it home
Just know I didn't die alone
Pretending this is all I want to say
Even if I'm turned into the wind
Pretending this is all I want to say as you cry this is good bye
Pretending this is all i want to say
Even though i've turned into the wind
Pretending this is all i want to say
It's not all i want to say
It's not all i want to say
That's all there is to say..."

Carpet floors turn to desert sand
A whisper crept up and stole my breath
Suddenly I stepped on a scorpion
I felt the poisoned sting
Inject and fill my veins
Skies blackened then the wind
Brought smiles and pouring rain
We walked into the reception
All the guests were dressed in white
The trumpets played in our honor
We're gonna dance tonight
Losing consciousness again
(Shadows dance upon the ceiling)
They'll never find me I'll be buried by the sand
(What has she done)
The trumpets fade into a whisper
And the guests returned home
She led me to the exit
When I heard the morning call
Losing consciousness again
(Shadows dance upon the ceiling)
They'll never find me I'll be buried by the sand
(What has she done)
And I'll die"

I lock the door but she walks through the walls
You won't get my sympathy this time
I lock the door but she walks through the walls, the walls

Had eternity and through it away and I'll be damned if I follow in your footsteps

I've been through the wasteland
I've wrestled your demons
Carried your burden now its time for you to carry it yourself
Pretend, pretend, pretend that you can't hear me begging you to leave
These rendezvous' are getting stale
And out of hand
Who are you to think that you could be the one to force this terrible engagement?
When I'm wide awake but I'm dreaming
I lock the door but she walks through the walls
You won't get my sympathy this time
I lock the door but she walks through the walls, the walls
Had eternity and through it away and I'll be damned if I follow in your footsteps
I've been through the wasteland
I've wrestled your demons
Carried your burden now its time for you to carry it yourself
I've been through the wasteland
I've wrestled your demons
Carried your burden now its time for you to carry it yourself
In your eyes I see a ghost
Break the glass by throwing stones
And I'm braced for anything
I'm braced
The glass will break [2x]"

Get my revenge by any means, If you take my life i will take your dreams\"
Now Mary was extra quiet
As she crept in through the bedroom door
All her anger took a life of its own

Get my revenge by any means, If you take my life i will take your dreams\"

Because tonight she's on a roll
Now all that's left's a bloody mess

She took a look at the scene and she thought
\"He looks better with an axe in his head\"
\"If you take my life, I will take your dreams
Get my revenge by any means, If you take my life i will take your dreams\"

We spent our nights out watching shadows walking
I can't tell if I've become one too
I let myself go numb
It only made thing worse
Splitting my time between shadows and light
Unaware of the difference
The trumpets still ringing in my head
Crunch sand between my teeth
Sandpaper tongues can't speak
Don't think ill ever speak again

Me haces falta en el aire para respirar
Vivo aferrado a un recuerdo y no tengo ms
Del pasado que se que ya no volver.
Hay tantas cosas que aun me recuerdan que no estas
Hay tanto espacio vaci, que aun nose como llenar
Es que dejaste una sombra en mi cuarto
y aparte el recuerdo de ti que me platica y se sienta a mi lado y me dice que no eres feliz
Y es que dejaste un espacio tan grande que no puedo llenar me falta todo y no encuentro a alguien que me ayude a olvidar
Y puede que esta llegue a no importar esto que estoy sintiendo hoy
Lo que me importa es este espacio tan fri y tan grande que solo lleno con tu nombre
Solo llenare con tu mirada
Hay tantas cosas que aun me recuerdan que no estas
Hay tanto espacio vaci, que aun nose como llenar
Es que dejaste una sombra en mi cuarto
Y parte el recuerdo de ti que me platica y se sienta a mi lado y me dice que no eres feliz
Y es que dejaste un espacio tan grande que no puedo llenar me falta todo y no encuentro a alguien que me ayude a olvidar
Y puede que esta llegue a no importar esto que estoy sintiendo hoy

Que solo llenare contigo amor, Hay tantos espacios, hay tantos espacios"

llenaste mi vida de felicidad, y ilusion,
desde este dia quieres desaparecer
dejandome solo, un porque y un adios,
y no, no puede ser asi,
despues de tanto tiempo que nos adoramos, tu y yo.
Esque el amor no acaba con un simple adios
que tu me has entregado,
no puede terminar, si todo iva tan bien,
que nos esta pasando,
esque el amor no acaba aunque quieras fingir
no puedes ocultarlo,
me lo dicen tus ojos y mirar tus labios
como estan temblando.

Procura fingir que nadie ah navegado por tu lindo cuerpo
Que nadie besÃ³ la cicatriz pequeÃ±a que adorna tu espalda

Que apague la voz para que no le grites mi maldito nombre
Y ojalÃ¡ el puÃ±o de diamantes que el te ah prometido
Soborne en tus ansias cuando sientas ganas de jugar con migo
Y que esos detalles se vuelvan cadenas de tus emociones
Para que no sufras el dolor que causan las desilusiones
Te prometo que nuestro romance morirÃ¡ en silencio
Yo haber como le hago pa' sanar del vicio de sentir tus labios
Rodar por mi piel besando cada espacio de mi anatomÃ­a

"1011" "He packed up his guitar
And drove Wednesday through Sunday
And sometimes played three shows a day
The modern lone rider, he dreamed of Ohio
And his doe-eyed Arabian bay
And how they'd go racing out on the hillside
In the cool closing twilight of day
Old friends together in thunderous freedom
Just the man and the wind and the bay.
Well, sometimes they'd ride down by the river
And the bay always stopped there to drink
In the still of the evening
The horse seemed contented
And the man used the time just to think.
And in the cold winds of winter
He's drawn to the barn
By some irresistable force
With carrots and a blanket
There's nothing more binding
Than the love of a man for his horse.
The call of the highway, how it would beckon
He kept going back out of course
And in the deep of the night
When the miles were the hardest
He just figured he drove for the horse.
And in all life's relations one thing stays the same
Never take more than you will repay
So we count the score even
'cause the miles he had driven
Were for miles that he rode on the bay.
They grew old together, got too old to ride
But just look at the seeds that they'd sowed
They'd walk out in the pasture, stand side by side
And stare off at the hills where they'd growed.
And of all God's creations here under heaven
There's many I can't understand
One beautiful mystery that I at least witnessed
Was the love of a horse for a man."

Angry words and broken hearts
Till silently we sit apart
You and I
But in awhile the anger's gone
And we forget who's right or wrong
Then one of us will end it all
With just a smile
We believe in happy endings
Never breaking
Only bending
Taking time enough for mending
The hurt inside
We believe in new beginnings
Giving in
And forgiving
We believe happy endings
You and I
Just a word is all it takes
And so it pass
The silence breaks
And looking back it makes us ache
For what we've done
And so we cling together now
And wonder why we're oh so proud
When all that matters anyhow
Is our love

Laid out on the street
White lightning in a bottle
Discarded at his feet

Play Dixie for me, Billy
I'll hold my head up proud
Sing about them fields of cotton
Sing it for me loud
Sing about the Bullruns
Sing about the day
I shot my brother dressed in blue
While I was dressed in grey
We marched out from Manassas
Cannons on our tail
Set fire to the cornfields
Tore up all the rails
Met up at the Bullrun
Neither broke away
The ballad of the bullrun
Told in blue and grey
They marched us down to Vicksburg
By then we didn't care
It didn't matter where we went
Our death was in the air
I had a couple brothers
And each of them would say
As one would shoot the other
A prayer for blue and grey"

To the little old church by the road
I could see the dear people and hear them so plain
Singing songs of that blessed dear Lord
I could hear my dear mother as she formidably prayed
Blessed Jesus help me carry my load
She was never downhearted never dismayed
In that little old church by the road
[Chorus]
There my mother would pray
And my sister was saved
Singing sinners come and repent of your sins
There the angels were crowded and the sisters would shout out
And the bread was saved amen
It was there I met Jesus and gave him my life
It was there he took the weight off my load
And he freely removed all my sorrow and strife
In that little old church by the road
I remember the preacher so gentle and brave
As he told how the father above
Gave his only son Jesus all the lost ones to save
Such wonderful wonderful love
I will always remember when the preacher would say
Come to Jesus he'll lighten your load
So often he preached of the life giving bread
In that little old church by the road
[Chorus]
I could never forget all those lovely old songs
That the people so joyfully sang
How they told the Lord's message to sinners gone wrong
And the echoes so joyfully rang
I would always remember how I truly believed
Jesus took all the weight off my load
And the joy of salvation I truly received
In that little old church by the road

But now I'm down to my last dime
I had a sweetheart but I was unfaithful
Oh I've lived a lot in my time
I fought the grim reaper down in the dark valley
Prayed when the sun wouldn't shine
I've looked through the bars of a cold lonely prison
Yes, I've lived a lot in my time
I've been a soldier and I've been a rambler
Once thought that everything was fine
I've put in the cornfields, I've picked in the cotton
Yes I've lived a lot in my time
I've walked with our Master down in the dark valley
And wonderful peace I did find
Someday I'll journey to Eden's green pastures
I've lived a lot in my time"

Then they put us on the Orphan Train and sent us way out West
To try to find someone to take us in
The farmers and the families, they came from miles around
We lined up on the platform of the station in each town
And one by one we parted, like some living lost-and-found
And one by one, we all were taken in

There's many a good preacher who can teach the golden rule
Who started out an orphan sleeping in the freezing rain
Whose life began out on the Orphan Train."

The dreamland of the world is on an island
The Indians were the first to stake their claim

They called it Cayo Hueso They came to Cayo Hueso
It was Cayo Hueso It was the king of Spain's
It was Cayo Hueso When they first reached Cayo Hueso
It was Cayo Hueso Because Skeleton's remained.
Wreckers were a rich part of its history
Running after ships that were going down
The first to get there claimed the loot.
Totally legal and all To Boot!
Then they'd bring the goods to auction in the town.

this little piece of paradise has everything you need
you'll never want to leave it when you come.

For they seceded from the union where others tried and failed
Dennis Wardlow took some bread and Broke it on a sailors head
Then surrendered to the Admiral. What a story that is to tell.
Only in Cayo Hueso Conch republic Cayo Hueso
Come on to Cayo Hueso. Through a road block asinine.

"1035" "The Last train to Paradise
Words and Music Chris Foster
copyright 2003 Chris Foster Music Publishing
What was known as a modern day marvel
A great railroad that crossed over sea
It defied all the whitecaps and the deep coral bed
And linked the whole world to the keys
Who should take on this lofty endeavor?
But a man who they said was obsessed
Who'd made millions of dollars refining crude oil
Now his focus was on reaching Key West
Skeptics and cynics who used pens as their lances
Took cheap shots at him and asked what were the chances
That the railroad you're building make good on the quest
Of rolling over the ocean right into Key West?
The Last train to paradise
They'd dubbed Flagler's folly for the use of a knife
Undeterred by their antics Henry went on with life
And drew up the plans for the last train to paradise.
It all started when he first came to Florida
His friends told him that he should retire
You could live off your wealth till the end of your days
But inside Henry still had his fire.
He said this place aint what it could be
With the weather so nice all year round
So I'll buy up the Halifax/ Jacksonville rail
And track it south from town to town.
We'll track over rivers and track over streams
We'll track over farmland and other mans dreams
We'll track it through mangroves and track it through the fields
And were we can't track we will dredge for the fill
We'll build the last train to paradise
New towns and new hotels where the weather is nice
Right on to Fort Dallas where they suffer no ice
He continued to build the last train to paradise.
When the railroad got as far south as Homestead.
They thought Henry, had then done his best
But in the back of his brain a notion remained
To take the railroad right on to Key West.
Where Deep water awaited the liners
and shipping trades to the canal.
But what stood in his way was the great Biscayne bay
And an inlet that spanned 7 miles.
Faced with the fact that he had to cross ocean
He put all his engineers minds into motion
Devising a plan to extend the great line
By building a sea bridge one arch at a time.
The last train to paradise
Rolled over the ocean against all advice
Almost in defiance he didn't think twice
He had completed the last train to paradise.
Mother nature had dealt him some losses
Hurricanes in 0 6 9 and 10
But his vision stayed strong and he vowed to go on
In the memory of the losses men
After 7 long years to completion
He rolled south in his car 91
He enjoyed every mile with a big eager smile
Because impossible things had been done
And the skeptics and cynics who had used pens as their lances
Were in awe of the man who had met their advances
Henry answered all questions and passed all the test
When the conductor yelled now arriving key west
The last train to paradise
Built with muscle and sweat and a vision precise
Unparalleled by what he accomplished in life
A divine inspiration. The Last train to paradise"
"1036" "The Storm of the Century
(the 1935 Labor Day hurricane song)
Words and music by Chris Foster January 9th 2003.
The keys are the islands along Florida Bay
There a paradise found for most all.
The locals all live the fine life everyday
Only few still alive may recall.
About the sea and its fury when it was torn by the gales
And how nothing could stand in its way
Saltwater canyons made of 30 feet swales
That came ashore one labor day
The pressure was falling the tides on the move.
It was nothing liked we'd ever seen
Winds from the north waves from the south
And a small piece of land in between.
We boarded up windows, pulled in our boats
Made our havens as safe as could be
We couldn't imagine what was to be
Everything would end up in the sea.
II.	The storm started coming the pressure was dropping
Large waves started hitting the beach
Lighting was flashing, timbers were flying
And safety was clear out of reach.
The railroad was sent from south of Miami
To rescue us but to no avail
A wave washed the train cars right off of the track
And it ate 30 miles of the rail
The wind knock me over I grabbed my sister
And she clang to me for her young life
She couldn't hang on despite fear in her eyes
And her fingernails digging like knives
I whispered I love you as she drifted away
Then some sand blasted me in the eye
I found refuge on the top of a tree
placed there by the 20 foot tide.
III	I awoke the next morning after being unconscious
The storm of the century had past
The slow falling rain mixed with tears in my eyes
As I wondered who all didn't last
No blade of grass no tree left standing
Every building was washed out to sea
Dazed and confused I stood comprehending
What my eyes told me to see.
Where is my family, where is my home
They were nowhere in sight, someone said
I sat by the water with my head in my hands
Wondering if I was better off dead?
I had to go on, they needed my help
As we mournfully stacked all the dead
We all said a prayer then we lit them on fire
Its an image that won't leave my head
IV.	Great walls of water swallowed some whole
In a battle between God and Man
Four hundred twenty three lives were the toll
And I will never quite understand
An 18-foot monument stands off US 1
With remains of so many who died.
Words of remembrance with the date etched in bronze
September 2nd 1935
I am so lucky that I'm hear to retell
God gave me a final reprieve
Nothing short of a miracle surviving the gales
As I desperately held to a tree
Now I share the memory with family and friends
Sleepless nights sure have riddled my life
Remembering all of the lives lost that day
Is a memory that cuts like a knife."

Terror on the high seas wrought by Charles Gibbs
Brandishing his sword in pirate fame
For wealth that surfed the currents between the old world and the new
Countless were the victims that he claimed
A modus operandi of debauchery and greed
No prisoners were the words of his command
A cruel and vicious person with a gross incessant need
To claim the life of every single hand
Chorus
They would hoist their mighty sails under the black flag
Catch a trade wind to their date with infamy
On a mission to destroy every time that they deployed
They lived a vile evil life of treachery
He sailed the Florida Straits searching for his prey
Stealing all the treasures from their fold
This madman on a mission would abscond with what he claimed
Pavilion key was where he stored his gold.
His ship would pull along side and tie their ropes to fore and aft
They'd swing aboard with lust and greedy hearts
They'd rape and murder woman and torture all the men
Then throw their bloody carcass to the sharks.
Repeat chorus
Sax solo
To romanticize a pirate is to make a mockery of life
The Dark ages from our past in maritime
But good traverses evil, so let the record show
Charles Gibbs was hung at the age 29

"1039" "Widow's Walk
Words and music Chris Foster
The storm clouds draped on the horizon
An his love climbed the stairs so she could see
On the second story perch of her protection
She blew him a kiss as he wandered off to sea.
The captain told him be on board by morning
The catch is running now, he knew he had to go
In about a day she will see him coming home
Through the inlet where the boats go to and fro
I will wait for my love in the morning
I will wait for my love in the day.
From on top of the roof from my widow's walk
I'll be wishing all your stormy clouds away
Sailors dance on mother natures cool clear waters
Spend the springtime of their lives in her fold
Sailors songs have been sung for thousands of years
But the widows story's rarely ever told
On cold dark nights she'll linger up ---- to her rooftop
Grasp the wooden rail with boney shaky hands
The salty air caresses worried cheeks of sorrow
As she ask her God to help understand
I will wait for your love in the sunshine
I will wait for your love in the rain
From on top of the roof from my widow's walk
I will wait for my love to come again
Solo
The time has come and gone for him to be home now
Another sleepless night upon her breast
Maybe it's the season or maybe some bad weather
But either way I will not get my rest.
I will wait for my love in the springtime
I will wait for my love in the fall
From on top of the roof from my widows walk
I'll wait until I hear your angel call.

February 5, 2003
Rolling over the highway Got the wind in my hair
While the sun is shining brightly down upon my face
Looking for an adventure Or for any old reason
That will lead me on a new exciting chase
I cant slow down I still have a lot to see
I'll blaze my path of glory from sea to shining sea.
Rolling over the highway
Rolling over the highway With the top of my car pulled down
While the radio is playing is turning back the years
Fingers tapping the dashboard Changing radio stations
Singing all the songs that are pleasing to my ears.
I've traveled through the countryside and I've seen a lot of towns
And I've waved hello to strangers when I've have my window down
Rolling over the highway
And I would take a trip to anywhere
As long as you were with me, I wouldn't have a care
Freedom must be wrestled from the grips of your existence
It doesn't take a miracle it only takes persistence.
Instrumental
Rolling over the highway Looking for a tomorrow
That only yesterday was impossible to see
Escaping to a forever Defining each moment
And accepting what it is I'm meant to be.
Heading to my future with my dream clutched in my hand
Arriving at the destiny of what it is I am
Rolling over the highway."

There??s a time to be faithful
There??s a time to be brave

Struggling to save

Every little piece of
What was left to me here
Every little shred
Of all I held dear

Until piece by piece
And bit by bit
I gathered them together
And I made them all fit
XII
Until standing tall
And feeling strong
I??m facing the future
And my life goes on
And then life still goes on

"1046" "The rain falls, the rain falls down
The rain falls, the rain falls down
The rain falls, the rain falls down
The rain falls, the rain falls down on me
Well I gotta get up
but I can't get my head out of bed 'cause I went to bed late
So I drag myself out
and I wonder about how I let myself get in this state
And my coffee's run out
and the milk has gone off and the last piece of bread has gone stale
And I hear myself curse,
when the heating won't work 'cause I didn't pay the bill right away
The cold air is chilling me
and my head is killing me and I've only got myself to blame
I swear that in future I'll be more together
I see my computer, so I go to check my mail
It takes me a while,
but eventually I get on line, and when I finally do
I open up my messages
the second one's from you....... then
The rain falls, the rain falls down
The rain falls, the rain falls down
The rain falls, the rain falls down
The rain falls, the rain falls down on me
So you're breaking it off
and you didn't think it could be said to me straight to my face
And those rumours were true,
you've got somebody new, you've been taking her out in my place
And now you want rid of me
you've gotta be kidding me, don't you think I want rid of you?
And No you cannot be my friend
My friends they come through..........when
The rain falls, the rain falls down
The rain falls, the rain falls down
The rain falls, the rain falls down
The rain falls, the rain falls down on me
Well I click on your mail
and I drag it away to the trash and I gather my strength
I delete your address
all along with the rest of the messages you ever sent
'Cause I will find someone new
someone who'll love me too, cherish me to have and to hold
And you will be the one we'll see
Out there in the cold.........when
The rain falls, the rain falls down
The rain falls, the rain falls down
The rain falls, the rain falls down
The rain falls, the rain falls down .......... (ad lib) ..........on me"

Why don't you falter?
How come you keep holding on

My eyes are blinded by
Something so pure

Touched by the chemical gun

Take me away

Neon lights ablaze that shine all over town
In brilliant conversation, with somebody new
He's out there showin' 'round

I'm lost among the faces
Where a sideways glance says romance on a whim
Pretty boys with blue eyes
Smilin' stylin' just reminding me of him
Please, heart, you're killing me
Please, heart, you're killing me
Can't go out at night
Can't stay here at home
Can't go anywhere
Cause he'll be there
Can't get out of bed
Can't get any sleep
Can't do anything
What does he care?
Does he care?
Everywhere I turn, I see
The past jump out in front of me \"hello\"
Someone's got it in for me
This whole damn town has secrets I don't know
Please, heart, you're killing me
Please, heart, you're killing me
Four a.m. I brave the cold
The garbage trucks are on a roll, \"surprise\",
A vision through the subway steam

Coming back here and cryin' to me?
Isn't it a little late to be

Coming back here and cryin' to me?

No spotlight no acclaim
There are no prizes due to you
For all your little games

In the middle of the night
You're asleep and yet you say
In your own sweet silent way
That everything's alright
And your hair is lying
'Cross the pillow by my head
You're unconscious to the night
You can't talk but that's alright
Let your breathing speak instead
I hear you breathing in
You breathe out on my skin
That's when I begin
To know you're near me
I don't turn on the light
I don't need to use my eyes
The heartbeat by my side
Tells me you're here with me
My senses can deceive me
When I'm sleepy and confused
from my heavy eyes I see
Only darkness around me
My dreams long since excused
Then my thoughts go racing
Through the cloisters of my brain
In those midnight hours I find
That you hypnotise my mind
With your soothing pulse again
I hear you breathing in
You breathe out on my skin
That's when I begin
To know you're near me
I don't turn on the light
I don't need to use my eyes
The heartbeat by my side
Tells me you're here with me"

I think you're scared of going under, so much more than you appear
It's not that I would be more capable than you would
I'd go on, that I know
I just wonder how my life would be without you,
So do you I suppose,
So do you I suppose,
It leaves me wondering if you love me,
It leaves me wondering if I care
It leaves me wondering if you love me,
and it leaves me wondering if I care
Common decency requires me not to act on how I feel,
Common sense conspires to warn me to behave in spite of me,
So I impose on you the thoughts that lie within me
Be they mine
Be they yours
Trying to guess what you are thinking when you're silent
But I can't be sure,
No I can't be sure
It leaves me wondering if you love me,
It leaves me wondering if I care
It leaves me wondering if you love me,
and it leaves me wondering if I care
Do I care?
Are we so beyond repair?
Or is everything okay?
When I leave it up to you
You don't tell me either way
It leaves me wondering if you love me,
It leaves me wondering if I care
It leaves me wondering if you love me,
and it leaves me wondering if I care
It leaves me wondering if you love me,
It leaves me wondering if I care
It leaves me wondering if you love me,

"1053" "I felt anticipation early in the spring
I looked forward to the riches it would bring
I smiled the day it led my heart to you
It seemed like the world was smiling too
We laughed and drank and sang in summertime
I felt your body always close to mine
Our love was so exciting and so new
It seemed like the world was lauging too
Things got colder when the autumn came along
But we straightened out the things that had gone wrong
As the leaves displayed their ever changing hue
It seemed like the world was changing too
The winter brought the rain and then the snow
And I cried out loud the day I saw you go
I didn't really know quite what to do
It seemed like the world was crying too"

She's driving through the sunshine
To Malibu
No children in the backseat
No husband at the wheel
No telling where she's going
Just followin' the highway
To where it leads
Dreamin' of leaving
That's all it is
Dreamin' of something
More than this
Dreamin' of leaving
That's all it is
Dreamin' of something
More than this
She looks out of her window
Water from the dishes
Running down the drain
Clouds on the horizon
Reflections of the pane
Serve only to remind her
Of how it is and how it might have been
Dreamin' of leaving
That's all it is
Dreamin' of something
More than this
Dreamin' of leaving
That's all it is
Dreamin' of something
More than this
She's standin' on the corner
The suitcase in her hand
Filled with promises
It's not about unfaithful
It's not about unkind
It's just some words they're missing
Some other words they left somewhere behind
Dreamin' of leaving
That's all it is
Dreamin' of something
More than this
Dreamin' of leaving
That's all it is
Dreamin' of something

So I'll be quick and concede defeat
All the evidence lies on your side

But don't go away thinking I had it planned
It wasn't part of my scheme to be hateful to you
Did I hurt you?
What can I say?
I am guilty
Of walking away
And the signals that I sent you
I never meant to
Did I hurt you?
Forgive me please
I am guilty
I let you believe
That I loved you
And I tried to
Still you were lied to
Believe me please when I say
Sometimes our hearts can lead us astray
Believe me I never knew
How much of a hold I had over you
And try if you can to let reason be heard
Don't let your anger be blind to my words
Don't cut me off if I try and explain it to you.
Did I hurt you?
What can I say?

I'd been let down and double crossed
I played the fool, I played my games
Winning some along the way
But all the same, it was a shame
And I've only me to blame
For how I'd lost my way
And so I locked myself inside
I nursed my broken wounded pride
And in my eagerness to hide
I left my heart behind
Oh what a cost, my heart got lost
But now it's been found
You picked it off the ground
And now you've come to soothe me
Bewitch me and amuse me
How did you ever choose me?
And if you will excuse me,
I'd like to return
The same to you
It's the least I can do
I got you to see me through
Looking out for what I do
Springing sunshine from the skies
Placing rainbows in my eyes
Got you watching out for me
Making sense of what I see
When my world is wearing blue
I got you to see me through
Your tongue is wrapped in solid gold
the greatest story ever told
With words that dance and sing to me
With eyes that shimmer like the sea
A refugee, who grew to be
The apple of my eye
I really don't know why
I was so taken by your face
That was the first of my mistakes
And though I'd many more to make
I am so glad that I fell down, and came around
To where you were
At the mercy of your charms
I fell into your arms
And it was then it hit me
That love had come to grip me
Of all the skills I'd with me
I'd nothing to equip me
With all I'd to do,
Now you're here
It all becomes clear
I got you to see me through
Looking out for what I do
Springing sunshine from the skies
Placing rainbows in my eyes
Got you watching out for me
Making sense of what I see
When my world is wearing blue
I got you to see me through
I got you to see me through
Looking out for what I do
Springing sunshine from the skies
Placing rainbows in my eyes
Got you watching out for me
Making sense of what I see
When my world is wearing blue
I got you to see me through"

Waiting in the bar

And spoke with strength of mind

The image of my own.

They're the things that bring me close to
All the sights and sounds that move me
And all the crazy loves that soothe me
'Til all the higher truths around me
Make a higher love surround me.

Go now, go now, before my tears begin to spill
Oh, won't you go, now, before they flood my face?
For I have not much time, you see
Except what pride that's left to me, so
Go now, go now, before I lose that too
Leave the talking
Till some future time ahead
The analysing
That's really better left unsaid
But maybe you could be the one to
Tell our friends what we have done
But please, now, leave now
And shut the door behind

Half asleep, half asleep.

With very steep sides,
I can't climb out
I'm trapped inside
It's a very deep hole,
With very steep sides
I can't climb out
Lord knows I`ve tried,
But I'm trapped inside
You know I`ve tried,
But I'm trapped inside.
What is it with me,
I make no sense
Why is it
I talk in future tense.
When I'm s'posed to sing
My voice it goes to shout
\"Can`t break out, I can`t break out\".
All my climbing up has me nowhere,
All of this can get too much to bear
All I`m tryin' to do is mend this beat up heart
That's a start, that's a start."

It isn't quite romance
But whatever it is
It's worth a chance
And if we close our eyes
We can always pretend
If it's not love
That's not the end
It isn't quite love
I cannot deny
But still here it is
It's worth a try
And if I expected more
Life doesn't work that way
So if it's not love
That's quite okay
How often have we cried for love that died?
Our tumbled pride on the floor
So let's take care of our affair
And let's not dare ask for more
It isn't quite love
It isn't quite romance
Still, here it is
It's got to be worth a chance
Let's close our eyes
Let's pretend
It's not quite love
You're quite a friend"

You think it's close now as you sleep within your bed.
Check out the fire
Check out the fire
Check out the fire overhead.
Children grow, playing with their toys
Acting out their fairytales in play
Children play, growing with the noise
Of television teaching them the way,
And while you're sometimes scared now
If you see the flames
You think the smoke's from far away,
You read the papers, saying the fire will not spread

Sweet the light, glowing neon blue
Of havens offering shelter from the storm
Sweet the sound, crackling in the grate
Of firelight, welcoming and warm

Before you're happy, having locked your doors at night

I praise myself for having made a life alone
I praise myself for working so hard
I give my praise where praise is due

It seems that I have taken quite a shine to you
And it seems that I'm in a mood to seduce
It seems that you have read my mind

Losing myself by what I find

Where is the drug?
Where is the healing?
Where is whatever will ease this pain?
There is nothing I won't swallow
To stop what's eating up my brain
And get my feeling back again
I hear tortured voices buried deep inside of my head,
I have restlessness and anger as a pillow for my bed.
I hope it won't be long 'til I can prove myself to be
Untarnished by what's followin' me
What is followin' me?
Where is the drug?
Where is the healing?
Where is whatever will ease this pain?
There is nothing I won't swallow
To stop what's eating up my brain

What of her mother's cries that surely she has suffered enough.
And when he's gone where is the justice in a child that knows his name
As a photo in a frame
A picture in a frame
Where is the drug?
Where is the healing?
Where is whatever will ease this pain?
There is nothing I won't swallow
To stop what's eating up my brain

I heard music lighting up my darkness
I felt the phrase melt away my sadness
A melody, as potent as wine
I let it sweep me out of my depression
I let it point me in a new direction
Breathing hope on this life of mine
Now who could fail
To let it touch the honesty within them?
And who could help
But be comforted inside?
It took a harmony to heal the bad times
It took a rhythm to release the sunshine
Even then, it took me so long
To break the silence I'd resigned my life to
To break down barriers I'd shut my eyes to
Releasing me from all that was wrong
Now I don't try
To understand the way it moves my spirit
That is why
S'pose I'll never know
How a subtle change of key
Can do these things to me
And make me feel like I feel"
"1069" "Save a little of your energy
Spend a little of your time with me
What is it that holds you here to me?
You must be moved by something that you see
Strains of magic in the moonlight hours
Render useless all your Earthly powers
Souvenirs of childhood haunt your face
It must be that they've fallen from your grace
And the rage burns inside
Like a cage that's open wide
Empty now, but once it held
The boundaries of your mind
Privacy and loneliness
They overlap sometimes, sometimes
Subtleties betray you everywhere
That's a secret you forgot to share
Like how auburn still brings out your guilty streak
And seemingly it adds to your mystique
Moody silhouettes, you soon replace
With swarms of passersby that flood your space
Your superficial scars, you can conceal
There are others left with wounds that will not heal
And the rage burns inside
Like a cage that's open wide
Empty now, but once it held
The boundaries of your mind
Privacy and loneliness
They overlap sometimes
Empty now, but once it held
The boundaries of your mind
Privacy and loneliness
They overlap sometimes
And the rage burns inside
Like a cage that's open wide
Empty now, but once it held
The boundaries of your mind
Privacy and loneliness
They overlap sometimes
Save a little of your energy
Spend a little of your time with me
What is it that holds you here to me?"
"1070" "Sleeping close in sweetness
Intimate in doubt
A little piece of rope around
To stop us falling out
And through the closed curtains
A copper-coloured light
And wine glasses
From last night
[Chorus]
Is it so forgotten?
Does it run so deep?
Is it so forgotten
Like the promises we keep?
Like the promises we keep
Like the promises we keep
I feel so broken
Feel so broken
I feel so broken
I feel...
Cigarette smoke, drifting up
To hanging plants behind
Particles of honesty
And tenderness entwined
Things with you are different now
And I can feel the strain
What is it that protects you from this pain?
[Chorus]
With the days that lie ahead me
I'm hungry to remain
Still, I know it's best to go
'Cause nothing's going to change
Eyes that held so much for me
Are holding things from me now
Like the harmonies
That life will not allow
[Chorus]"
"1071" "Keep the weatherman sweet,
Then begin sweeping the driveway.
News is that the heat's
Coming in, Thursday or Friday.
Now I'm a little slow to see
How weatherman's words are gonna satisfy me
Words can change my point of view
Only if they prove to be true
Seven inches of rain,
I believe it's gonna get wetter
Seven days of the week.
Hopes are high it's gonna get better
Now, I'm not in the hoping game
That's a kind of a pity and a bit of a shame
But hope can be a two-edged sword
And a luxury that I just can't afford
Twelve days, snow would spread the cold around
Twelve days heat would melt the snow on the ground
Twelve days sun is what I'm looking for now
Twelve days grey what's in store.
Keep the weatherman sweet
Then go off, buy an umbrella
Go and wait for the sun
Go and dream beautiful weather
I'm much too old for dreams
Now that's a little bit sad,
But not as sad as it seems
When dreams have been a thorny crown
It's not so sad when they're tumblin' down"
"1072" "Lying here naked with me
Can you see
Tears that I can't hide
If I could tell you about it
I would
But I couldn't if I tried
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why
When I don't know
Lying here naked I try
Not to cry
In your tender loving hands
Sometimes you touch an emotion
In me
That I just don't understand
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why
When I don't know
Don't ask me why
These tears of mine will flow
Don't ask me why

Put it down to the way I love champagne
Put it down to compatibility
And put your lips to mine again
Put your lips to mine again
No I don`t mind
And to be precise
If you did well, it would
Be kind of nice
So let that sparkle overflow,oh,
Don`t be shy, don`t be shy, don`t be shy

I love the fact that first you
Asked anyway

Make me smile, make me smile, make me smile

Really it`s fine
Gentle shivers running down my spine
Have me feeling to my toes,
Satisfied, satisfied, satisfied
Put it down to my biochemistry
Put it down to the way I love champagne
Put it down to compatibility
Put your lips to mine again
Put it down to my biochemistry
Put it down to the way I hate the rain
Put it down to compatibility

"1074" "In case of loving unreturned
Unrequited fingers burn
Don't you blame yourself at all
There is no blame, there is no crime
This madness happens all the time
Nothing there to break your fall
I understand how hard it's been
I've been there too and I have seen
What running after love can do
That feeling deep down in your soul
That searing, empty, gaping hole
Has dug a hole in my life too
My darling, my darling
So crazy, so charming
It's just that it happened too soon
But I send you my wishes
My hugs and my kisses
And whisper a prayer to the moon
In case you've lost your faith in life
In case you cannot sleep at night
Be certain this will take its toll
I recognize those waves of pain
I've known them time and time again
And would not wish them on a soul
My darling, my darling
So crazy, so charming
It's just that it happened too soon
I send you my wishes
My hugs and my kisses
Whisper a prayer to the moon
In cases lying by your door
A life is packed to go once more
There was no intent to deceive
Please bear no grudge, just bear your soul
It's hardly bearable to go
And barely possible to leave
Oh, my sweet tempered angel
I wish I were able
To heal all that hurt with a tune
And if I had the powers
I would give you the stars
The sun and the light of the moon
Oh, my darling, my darling
So crazy, so charming
It's just that it happened too soon
But I send you my wishes
My hugs and my kisses
And whisper a prayer to the moon
Oh, my darling, my darling
So crazy, so charming
It's just that it happened too soon
I send you my wishes
My hugs and my kisses
Whisper a prayer to the moon
I whisper a prayer
I whisper a prayer
I whisper a prayer to the moon
I whisper a prayer
I whisper a prayer
I whisper a prayer to the moon"
"1075" "She's graceful to the eye
Elegant and tall
To see her walking by,
You'd think she had it all.
But I see her all the time now
A little red around the eyes now
Even so, it doesn't show
'Til I hear it in her words there
Just a little bit slurred there,
Then I know, I know,
[Chorus:]
That she's drinking again,
Started sinking again
What's she thinking of then?
Well I don't know.
But she's drinking again
Started sinking again
What's she thinking of then?
Well I don't know.
None of this is new
It all went down before
When she made it through
I thought she knew the score
But she's nothing left to hope with
And it's such a lot to cope with
Even still, I think she will,
She's trying really hard now,
But letting down her guard now
Until, until,
[Chorus]
She dreamed of being so fine,
She dreamed of having someone by her side
And even when her dream had died,
She dreamed that she could somehow make it right
Lipstick smudging her face
Hair all over the place
They say she's a disgrace
But they don't know
If she's drinkin' a lot
And if she says that she's not
Is she able to stop?
Well I don't know

Your willingness is a jewel to me

Made music of it all
Yes, your body, I recall
Made music of it all
With your lips next to my lips
The night would be so much easier
The day not as hard to face
With you inside this empty space
And with your skin next to my skin
The night ahead could be beautiful
Your body, I recall
Made music of it all
Yes, your body, I recall
Made music of it all
And its been such a battle to change
It's been such a battle to rearrange
My life, my days, and the way I feel
But one more night to spend with you
Just one more night of holding you
Though I know in my heart and soul
It wouldn't change a thing
Just a little comfort; bring
Comfort from you
The white light on the water
The changes in you and your attitude
Your body, I recall
Made music of it all
Yes, your body, I recall
Made music of it all
The music of it all
The music of it all
The music of it all

It's not what you did has me aching so much,
It's not what you did that is hurting the most
It's the lies that you told, covering up
Please, please don't say how much you think of me
Please, please don't say how much you cared
Please, don`t say that you'd never lie to me
Spare me those lies you've prepared.
I'm not above feeling foolish
I'm not above being betrayed
I'm not above, singing stories of love,
But God how my stories have changed
It's not what you did has me sleepless
It's not what you did has me aching so much
It's not what you did that is hurting the most
It's lies that you told me, those lies that you told me.

Please, don`t say that you'd never lie to me
Spare me those lies you've prepared."

For you, for you
The moments I steal
You know they don't heal
The way I feel for you
For you, for you
The things that I say
They give it away
The way I feel for you
You know I need your precious time
To keep me going
To keep me going and to stop it from showing
And you know I need you by my side
To keep me hoping and to stop me from knowing
That someday, in someway
I'll make you fall for me
And sometimes I'll make you mine
And make you feel for me
The way I feel
[Chorus]
You know I feel alone these days
I'm thinking about you
I'm thinking about you; I'm dying without you
You know it's more than a passing phase
Been too long without you
I've been too long without you, crying about you
But someday, in someway
I'll make you fall for me
And sometime I'll make you mine
And make you feel for me
The way I feel"

From my bewildered eyes
Taste of bitter sweet romance
You're still in my hopes
You're still on my mind
And even though I manage on my own

My heart is low
my heart is so low
As only a woman's heart can be
As only a woman's
as only a woman's
As only a woman's heart can know
When restless eyes
Reveal my troubled soul
And memories flood my weary heart
I mourn for my dreams
I mourn for my wasted love
And while I know that I'll survive alone

She'd see it through
She'd love it too

Leave her now
Leave her now
She'll be back online, give a little time
So leave her now
Leave her now
She'll make it through somehow
She'll be back in style with a little smile

For a while
She reads what everyone has said
And hangs the cards beside the bed
It dulls the ache
She lies awake
At first she cried, but in the end
She knew she'd cope, and she had friends
So she was strong
And life goes on, and on, and on

"1082" "Cafe windows, street lamps
Neon lights ablaze that shine all over town
In brilliant conversation, with somebody new
He's out there showin' 'round
Please, heart, you're killing me
I'm lost among the faces
Where a sideways glance says romance on a whim
Pretty boys with blue eyes
Smilin' stylin' just reminding me of him
Please, heart, you're killing me
Please, heart, you're killing me
Can't go out at night
Can't stay here at home
Can't go anywhere
Cause he'll be there
Can't get out of bed
Can't get any sleep
Can't do anything
What does he care?
Does he care?
Everywhere I turn, I see
The past jump out in front of me \"hello\"
Someone's got it in for me
This whole damn town has secrets I don't know
Please, heart, you're killing me
Please, heart, you're killing me
Four a.m. I brave the cold
The garbage trucks are on a roll, \"surprise\",
A vision through the subway steam
I see him and I can't believe my eyes
Please, heart, you're killing me
Please, heart, you're killing me
You're killing me
You're killing me
You're killing me
Stop killing me"
"1083" "Smells of toast and coffee served to put in mind his name today
Never did take much to get me thinking about him anyway
In time I may progress to welcoming the coffee`s scent
At present I have no such strength.
Is there no poetry, no melody to comfort me,
To blur these images, etched upon my memory.
My stereo is where I go to let the sunshine in,
But every note`s like one from him.
All that surrounds me,
Won`t let him go,
All that surrounds me
Won`t let him go.
If falling rain could only wash away my memories
Then I would welcome rain and never let it bother me
From my windowsill I`d watch the drops and then begin
To picture him soaked to the skin."
"1084" "Lost touch, long ago,
It didn't end so well, I know
Lashed out, had a row
Don't know where home is for you now
Your drink should not have stayed undrunk
You should have drunk it down with your prayers
I showed no mercy to you then
No mercy when
Chorus
A glass unkissed by human lips
A glass untouched by human hands
A glass unbroken cut the skin
'till we bled
A glass unkissed by human lips
A glass untouched by human hands
A glass unbroken cut us both
'till we bled
Lost all in the end
Threw out the suffering of a friend
Let's hope life is kind
And will deliver peace of mind
Forgive this crazy one
Her crazey time in hell
She keeps her silence now
And means you well"
"1085" "He comes to me and sets my thoughts astray
He comes to chase the midnight blues away
He's sweet to taste and strong to touch
And with his second sight
He steals away the lonesomeness of night
It seems that heaven's looked on me and smiled
It sent the sun in place of candlelight
Tumbled out my wildest dreams
Tossed away my worst
Has heaven sent a blessing or a curse?
He talks to me, but nothing does he tell
He talks but keeps his secret safe and well
Still, I cannot help but reach for him
With these helpless hands of mine
So, I hug him close and pray to God he's mine
He comes to me and sets my thoughts astray
He comes to chase the midnight blues away
He's sweet to taste and strong to touch
I find myself inclined
To hug him close and pray to God he's kind
I hug him close and pray to God he's kind"

Where it is you're coming from
Draw a curtain
Close your eyes
When history's pages fail you.
I will not open up those history books
That's not for me to do.
Precious little in your life
Is yours by right
And won without a fight
Precious little in your life
Is yours by right
And won without a fight.
Shadows call me,
In the wind

Angels guide me
From the clouds

Shake your beads out
Kneeling down
It will not pass me by
Two people coming from a different place
Maybe neither one is right.

By surprise, by surprise
At times he knew he'd failed her
At times he really tried

But that wasn't true, wasn't true

In fragments much too tiny

I will go to my own sweet bed tonight,
It`s much too hard, to explain.
So take some comfort in that whiskey,
It`s often been my friend,
And if it warms a lonely body,
Well who`s to say it`s bad.
I will go to my own sweet bed tonight,
I won`t try to explain.
I will go to my own sweet bed tonight,
It`s much too hard, to explain.
If kindness takes a little longer
It`s worth the extra time,
Some have lives so long in darkness,
They don`t even recognise the light.
Understand, there`s a child in everyone,
We should watch what we say.
Everyone has their battles and their pain,
Hidden somewhere away.

You're sending your love to war
With a doctor and a locked up door
You only learned to pack it up a year ago at the corner store
Where the bandage made your blood run boiled
And you're running cause you're so hardcore
Chours:
And all the ladies dance and swoon
To the tango tune
By the big pi moon?
Oh while your brothers warn each other with their lavish lyric tunes
Oh lover never loved me though I do
And said the doctor to your heart you never ever should have come so far
You couldn't blame it on your new guitar
You wouldn't play it at the whisky bar
And it's been 24 years running up and down the wrong side of
The streets you lived on were not made for love
Write a letter, send a war cry dove

Yes I do have your picture in my car
Where I dream that I'm driving fast and far
And I do want you badly like I said so
Oh whoa when I dreamed how I loved you soft and slow
But never mind the invitation it was all a form of so and so
And we've both had enough of stop and go
And now you wish you'd never said hello
Until we're back into the station where the radio is blaring on
And all the war brides sing their soldiers songs
The night is sure dear but the love is long

I've been wearing that over coat for seven years
Long, long years

Thumbing my way through those hip cat scenes
Rambling on

Waltzing my tears to a Tom Jones song

Just to show me how its done I think
Oh but I get things in my own way
When that sun goes away I drink
Drinking to the moon and the stars

Oh where you won't find me

Da dad a dad a da da

Of shadow, of song
And raddled the windows,
And the tiny regrets
And the tiny glasses houses
That I tried to forget
Drink til your sleeping,
I love you that way
Like we are all babies;
All our beds are unmade
No memory has molded
Enough to forget
And our tiny glass houses
Are not built for us yet
Takes all of the courage,
And none of the pride,
To stand in the threshold-
To sit down inside
Where we are not babies;
No we are not new
And our tiny glass houses
With the beautiful view
There's a crack in my memory
Where a funeral parade,
Rolls through the doorway
That my memory made
And funeral marches
To its funeral sounds
And the tiny glass houses
Are all tumbling down
And tiny glass houses,
Are all tumbling down

Lead you back to the wreckage of change
Build your bridges, learn your name
Cross the river in three good strides
Left the company wild with pride
River ribbon all around your legs
Gripped the surface and you turned your head
Jump the line and turn the key
Lose your guard, believe in me
I can love you best of all
I am the wrecking ball.
Hallelujah changed your tune
The sky was open for you all too soon
Left the cradle in the rockin' wind
Ran from nothing like it's everything
Night can turn the mirror on
Saw your face and it looked all wrong
Where are the eyes that you looked out from?
Two young coins in the rising sun
So you curb and then the tragedy
You put your faith in a reverie
All good soldiers stand for thee
Losing battles in front row seats
As your shoulders curl and bend with time
Then love and hatred must combine
You turn the page to reconcile
You see, I've loved you all the while"

Did you praise the line and blame the words

Rubies and emeralds,
Sapphires and such
Outlive me, outlive me

And you will talk of golden river flow
And given you enough

Bye, bye, Montreal

From the warnings we have run
Now from a figure we have cut the mold

How I cover love but I have not changed"

And silver don't lead to your door?
Will you take comfort
That you have been taken before?
Oh, every intention has paved every path
They followed through driftwood and moor
What haunts you the most only lives to outlast
Cast off the best, the rest of all sorrows
Left to the gallows, the palace of all that you are

Blue in the phrases of letting go"

You don't look much like you care

Will you need me in the spring?

And its dragging me around among the needles and the pins
And I don't need to take a breather
I'm on the outside looking out
Yeah, I don't need to see your papers
'Cause I know what you're about
You had me by the bible and you had me by the belt
And you had me from the instant my cold love began to melt
And then you praise me for my inspiration
Asked me for an explanation
Followed up with hesitation
Fit my primal expectation
I don't care but I don't mind
You can call me any time
You can holler through the fortress
And kick me out of line
I don't expect it from the grief that gathers in my head
I like suspended disbelief
I like to spend the day in bed
I like to spend the nights in heaven
Hanging with the dead
You know, Judas and his women and the voices in my head
I've got my eyes upon the mirror
I've got my hands up in the air
I confess to my distress yeah, I great crazier each year
You know I'd change it if I could you know I like to say that I would
But there's a war between the parts of me
The evil and the good
And you try and stop me I'm on fire
It doesn't look that way
You know, I used to be a liar
But living's set me straight
I don't come with no disclaimer I'm like everybody else
We keep our demons on the burner and our morals on the shelf
And nobody asks for my opinion because you don't want to hear
I swear I'm only human wishing I could disappear
And you must think its an illusion that I like to live in fear
Of a probable solution of why the devil put me here
And now no judgement call will kill me
Just makes me close my eyes
And I sink into the slumber to the prison of my mind
Where I'd love to introduce you
If you found a way inside
You could sell me retribution and totally demystify
Until I wonder how I got here
Until I don't know who to be
Is it better to be grounded?
Is it better to be free?
Am I better off without you?
Am I happier alone?
Hello, its me the mistress, could you please pick up the phone?"

And the red face prophets are claimin' their fame
But I don't remember their names
Morning comes like a broken-winged bird
As though daylight delivers a miracle cure
And here in the pink of a dangerous day
Forgive me, forgive me,

In your eyes something to see
In your eyes pastures of green
In the company quarter the company store
Stays making the bargain that it made before
All the people are gathered ring a roundabout
Keep their parts in their pockets bring that company down
In history wayfaring armies
Cavalries above and beyond
Some were made of mothers own babies
Some were made of mothers own young
In a small dark alley where the sun won't go
There's got to be something maybe diamonds and pearls
All the people are gathered ring a roundabout
Keep their parts in their pockets find that dark alley out
Oh mystery gem of the moment
Chivalry got lost in your smile
Some may say there's nothing to comment
Some may stay silent awhile"

And yesterday has fled my view

Chanting the relief in dying
In which I'm not denying
Pointing its finger at my misery
Mocking my destiny
Selling the easy way out

Contorted through submission
It took life to a higher position

Shining with strongest might
Guiding to the homicidal paths
And to unleash ungodly wrath
I've seen the black light
Blinding with strongest might
Showing me the homicidal way
As I slowly become its slave
..The price all must pay
There must be no mercy for the
insignificant and weak
It's no tragedy that all this misery must
be cleansed through me

"1123" "Prologue: By the winter of 1350
It swept the land in an uncontrolled
outburst
Famine, cold and pestilential misery
Surely this must be a divine damnation
Punishment from below
Be it devil or demon that reaps this
cursed nation
No one of us deserves suffering thus
Oh lord, what have we done
Oh God, have you forsaken us?
I ride the night air
On pestilential wings
I am the nightmare
That slays your kith and kin
I ride your bed at night
An incubus so vile
My work is seen throughout
The smoke of funeral pyres
Black rats do my work
Punishment begins
Cover your face, everyone has heard
Here is payment for your sins
This epoch you won't forget
You're burning from inside
In the final throes of horrid death
The proudest men forget their pride
They cry in pain immense
Praying to be spared
But your god seems not to care
Mothers, daughters, fathers, sons
All are prey alike
Twitching in rotten bowel runs
I crave a heavy toll
The deadringers sound the bell
For all of you who fell
I reap the field in rage
You scream in mindless fear
When gripped in my embrace
I purify, you putrefy, the end I provide
For your blasphemy, I bring you
disease, a funeral feast
I take the helm and steer you into, a
hellish domain
You fall in the streets, succumb in
your sheets, diabolic disease
And you don't know why
Why your children die
And you won't know why
On winds of death I ride
Now summer has come over
the city
Midday heat is low
The surviving few bring out
their dead
A neverending flow...
I am the death, upon your black
breath, I am black death
I am the reason, that children lie
crying, watching their parents
dying
And I am formless, always
relentless, something you
cannot see
And I am evil, I am disaster, I am
catastrophe
By the end of 1352, two thirds
are gone
A horrible tale of pestilence and
plague, darkness and woe
Now I subside, slowly die out,
yet I have won
But I will return, in futures to
come, in different forms

"1125" "A downward spiral of misery, pain
and defeat
A life in ruins.
Promises made. But only deceit.
Face down. Always spat on, hated,
despised

The search for \"a life\" is no longer
an option
Backs turned, Friends forget

Why do I criticize?

Say your prayers ... now you die

Incantations, spoken at the stroke of midnight,
exhume their bodies from their timeless slumber
Soulless participants in this unholy ritual,
the dead crawl from their earthen prisons
Bodies decayed beyond recognition, they amass,
prepare nightmares from the darkest recess of your imagination
Tormented by lusty unquenchable thirst for blood
they are driven on loosed of the shackles
and free of the grave their vengeance knows no bounds
Raging hunger pierces the black, in the flicker of their morbid gaze
Creatures of evil spawned and spewn from the depths of hell
Moaning with desire for the flesh of the unsuspecting victims of their attack
wanton destruction burns in their hearts as they enter the land of the living
Rise frenzied lust for flesh.
Your blood seeps through my chest
You are the living dead.
Storming god's planet earth
Shambling gait downcast eyes retrogress from the grave
Empithely spewing pus from their lifeless veins
Decayed legions cast from Hades rotting lungs exposed
Maggots feed and the smell of death overcomes and cripples all
Lifeless emissaries of evil crazed
by the pleasure of their vile inhumanities
Wretched outcasts of the underworld
condemned to roam the earth and kill all that lives...

They will march for satan-demons-guardians of the damned
Vile-haunting-soulless creatures, satan's-legions of the dead
The darkest day of horror the world has ever known!"
"1129" "I feel the dark embrace the light
I see the black engulf the white
I can sense it, life denying
Take me from this cold fucking world
Life defying
...Hating everything
Life declining...
Seems there's no time for me
Cursing my own destiny
Sorrow flies on black wings
Riding the cursed wings of grief
Silence!
Hear sorrow laughing
Hear joy crying
Ride the black wings of sorrow
Silence!
Hear death screaming
Hear life dying
After going through
the darkest nightmares
I could only trust my self.
For the ones who loved me...
...will be happy to hate me
Don't just stand there!
My black tree withers
Take me away to the forest of believes.
Where the roots will rest
and I can have... serenity!
I want to feel the black rivers water
The current gliding me...
...Towards... Eternity.
Trashing what's left
Ripping, biting and cutting my flesh
Destroying this shell,
to finally escape my private hell"
"1130" "I play and sing
Dawn
When they ask me for my autograph
I catch you in the corner of my eye
And I know that smile upon your face
Means we made it girl, you and I
From the hard life on the south side
To the spotlight here on the stage
[Chorus:]
Now watch me play
Hear me sing la-la-la la-la-la-la
I play and sing for you la-la-la-la
Hear the applause
Without you, no telling where I'd be
Singing me a different song
Breaking rocks for ten or twenty years
But you wouldn't let me go wrong
Standing by me 'cause you love me
Now darling, this one's for you
[Chorus x3]
Now watch me play
Hear me sing la-la-la la-la-la-la"
"1131" "Tonight I'm yours,
And you are mine, now.
But is it love,
Or just summertime, now?
Ooh, the time is right,
Come hold me tight.
Let's grab onto the love that we can borrow.
And let's not hang each other up,
With words that we'll forget about tomorrow.
Cause the things we write in the summer sand,
The \"I love you\"'s and the future plans,
Disappear, slip right through your hand,
Like this warm, soft bed of summer sand.
You got someone,
And so do I, now.
Our hearts are locked in,
So why should we lie, now?
Bathe with me in harmony.
Let's sing our summer song and sing it sweetly,
For we can't stop the autumn wind that blows away,
The summer sand completely.
Yes, the things we write in the summer sand,
The \"I love you\"'s and the future plans,
Disappear, slip right through your hand,
Like this warm, soft bed of summer sand.
Oh, the time is right,
Come hold me tight.
Let's grab onto the love that we can borrow.
And let's not hang each other up,
With words that we'll forget about tomorrow.
Cause the things we write in the summer sands,
The \"I love you\"'s and the future plans,
Disappear, slip right through your hand,

Disappear, slip right through your hand,

Nagtatanong, nangangarap na ika'y magisnang muli

And all their friends bring pretty flowers while the band plays a happy

What do you say now? If it's a nice day now
What are you doing Sunday baby? Gee, I want to marry you
Oh, what are you doing Sunday afternoon?
Maybe we should wait 'til night to join hands 'neath the stars above
And we'll be kissing our first kiss by moonlight as we vow eternal love

Can you hear my heart saying it too
I could fall all over and over again
In love with a girl like you
You've been my by my side through the good and the tears

And the unseen forces above
They will ride on as one
They will brave the storm
Till the rains are over and done
Ride on crazy horse
Take me to the hills
Beyond the battle, where the waters are still
Where it's so quiet you can hear the children run
Far away from the sound of the gun
These are the feathers of a golded eagle
These are the feathers of an ancient people
You must, you must set my people free

In a dusty run-down honky tonk sits a drifting tumbleweed
Thumbing through some magazine that he can't even read
Now tumbleweed remembers how the west was won and lost
The homestead act and the dust bowl, everybody paid the cost
And the great white father promised to treat his children all the same
Back when Indian territory was Oklahoma's name
Oh tumbleweed keep rollin', he just roams from town to town
It ain't easy for a half-breed kid to try and settle down
Tumbleweed keep rollin', he can't find no place to rest
Yeah the desert wind blows tumbleweed like some spirit of the west
Well his boot heals tap in time to an old flat top guitar
And he's a guitar local hero and he sings straight from the heart
And his tip jar just a jungle of worn old dollar bills
He makes his rent and grocery in the local bar and grill
When he starts to picking that old guitar you know the people turn and stare
When he starts to sing the songs he wrote wells there's magic in the air
'Cause his song can heal your wounded heart, he can set you spirit free
He can raise you hopes to be the very best that you can be
Oh tumbleweed keep rollin', he just roams from town to town
It ain't easy for a half-breed kid to try and settle down
Tumbleweed keep rollin', he can't find no place to rest
Yeah the desert wind blows tumbleweed like some spirit of the west
So if you cross the Mississippi, you head out on the open plain
And you pass through Oklahoma and the sky begins to rain
And you feeling kind of rootless, you can't find no place to rest
Just remember tumbleweed, he's the spirit of the west
Oh the desert blows old tumbleweed like some spirit of the west"

In a bordertown down in Mexico, where all the lonely cowboys go
Stands a mission church at the end of a crowded street
Was there I first caught sight of her alone, my heart began to stir
She was kneeling there at the foot of a painted cross
On the borderline,
Crossing the heartlands again and again
On the borderline,
If lightning would strike me, I'd never know when
My heart must always remain on the borderline
Had to stay another day if only just to find a way to meet that girl who prays by the lonesome grave
They say she lost her only one to a battle of the blazing guns
Now she cries each night and her tears stain the desert sand
She vowed to never give her heart to someone else if they should part
I'll never meet those eyes to tell her I love her so

An angry young man is shaking his fist on the river of time
Roll on river of time, rage on river of time
There are faces and places I hold sacred
Some I've passed along the way
Some live on in memory, some I've passed along the way
With the rain from a storm, a river is born
Winding down to the sea, and the river of time
Keeps on rollin' thru eternity
The angry young man learns how to forgive
On the river of time
He holds an innocent child in his arms
On the river of time
Roll on river of time
Rage on river of time"
"1255" "Look for me on the mountain
Cry to me on the winds
Call for me in the canyons
And you will find me again
Come to me with your sorrow
Come to me with your pain
I have seen your tomorrow
But tonight brings the rain
After the storm is over
And the rains have come and gone
After the storm is over
I was there all along
Reach for me when you're broken
When the journey is too long
When all your worry is unspoken
For in your weakness I am strong
Call to me from the darkness
Turn to me when you thirst
Come to me when you're homeless
Then the last will be first"
"1256" "In the Beartooth Mountains where the twin peaks touch the sky
There's a homemade cabin out of sight from tourists' eyes
And inside lightin' up a fire to fight the cold
Lives a miner's daughter with a heart as pure as gold
She's as gentle flowin' as the sweet grass on the plains
And I need her lovin' like the forest needs the rain
Like a rollin' river she just swept my heart away
Now I'm out here driftin' when I know I should've stayed
Oh, that west wind is callin' in skies of turqoise blue
And the creek is still runnin' like quicksilver dew
She was all that I needed, why did I ever leave?
Oh, her voice voice on the westwind is still callin' me
There's a cold wind blowin' through this mountain pass tonight
As I hold her memory to my heart it don't seem right
Just an empty cabin with a lock left on the door
Now I realize that I've lost the girl for sure
So I went up to Red Lodge to see if they might know
All the townfolk said that she left sometime ago
She just up and married with a nice young city man
I was a fool to let her slip right through my hands"

"1259" "Deep in the heart of a city night
There's a young girl dancing free
Twiling in circle by the front porch light
Out on the street of dreams, out on the street of dreams
Further down there's a family
there's a young couple in their teens
Their baby smiling at a barking dog
It was down on the street of dreams
There on the street of dreams
And they still go where they want to
And the will be who the will be
Cause there are no walls around their hearts
On the street of dreams, their on the street of dreams
Two older men talk of days gone by
And of a world they've never seen
Their hearts are young but they've traveled far
On down the street of dreams, their on the street of dreams
And they still go where they want to
And the will be who the will be
Cause there are no walls around their hearts
On the street of dreams
And you can go where you want to
You can be who you will be
Cause there are no walls around your heart
On the street of dreams
And you can go where you want to
You can be who you will be
Cause there are no walls around your heart
On the street of dreams, we're on the street of dreams
Deep in the heart of a city night

Twiling in circle by the front porch light
Out on the street of dreams, out on the street of dreams
There on the street of dreams......
Were on the street of dreams."

There's a trail your heart must follow no one but you could ever know
Where the winds and the coyote sing a song you've never heard
From a place that's long forgotten but you'll remember every word

In a world that's always changing find the things that stay the same
Like the moon and stars that guide you out across the sweeping plain
Keep your eye on the horizon when you cross that great divide
All you have is what's inside you when you take that lonesome ride
Forever ride, forever ride, forever ride?
So go to sleep now little brother, dream of red tails in the west
I know until you find your way there, your crazy soul will never rest
We'll chase the horses in the springtime, when the desert flowers bloom
You may never hear my footstep, but I will always be with you

"1263" "A tall black cowboy hat pulled down low to hide his eyes
While lines of weekend window shoppers just kept rollin' by
I spotted him from my old truck as he stood out in the crowd
He was a little more than twice my age, but he still looked strong and proud
Hadn't seen my uncle now since I was seventeen
And the stories of the wild, wild west kept comin' back to me
He didn't say too much, just tipped his has as he closed the old truck door
And I knew that this trip down Highway 10 would bring me so much more
Where the old man and the little boy could see things eye to eye
He took me back to a place in time where legends never die...
His hands and face were lined and weathered, they told stories of their own
His skin as red as desert clay, his eyes as black as coal
He was a cowboy and an Indian, just a little bit of both
For years of working the ranches and rodeos he didn't have much to show
Then he closed his eyes and spoke to me, his voice was like the wind
And that truck turned into a raging steed so he could ride again
He grabbed the colors from the sky, put them in his hands,
Sprinkled them across the road like grains of colored sand."

Some were always held and had a fire to keep them warm
Some are born to poverty with no roof above their head
Some are facing suicide and wishin' they were dead
There are those with flowing rivers right outside their door
Refugees in boats who may never reach the shore
Some pray for rain and the pay for it in blood
When it rains for forty days we are all victims of the flood
Somewhere a brave heart must survive
Yes someday the truth will bury the lie
Yah somewhere a brave heart must survive
Too many here been prisoners deserving to be free
Too many in the darkness and they have no eyes to see
In the middle of the night they are taken from their homes
And they dig a common grave to cover up their flesh and bones
But a new day in dawning for the beggars and the blind
For those who have suffered and were always left behind
But the chains will be broken and the fences will come down
And we will walk as brothers once again on the sacred ground
Somewhere a brave heart must survive
Yes someday the truth will bury the lie
Yah somewhere a brave heart must survive"

Its rollin' 'round the bend
I ain't seen the sunshine since, I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, time keeps dragging on
But that train just keeps on rollin', on down to San Anton'
When I was just a baby, mama told me son
She said always be a good boy, don't you ever play with guns
But I shoot a man in Reno, just to what he die
When I hear that lonesome whistle blow, I hang my head down and cry
Well I bet there's rich folk eating in some fancy dining car
Probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know, I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But that train just keeps on rollin', that's what tortures me
Keep on rollin'...
Well if they freed me from that prison and that railroad train was mine
I bet I move it on, just a little farther down that line
Far from Folson Prison, is where I want to stay
Well I let that lonesome whistle blow, blow my blues away
Well I let that lonesome whistle blow, just blow my blues away"

Are your all, maybe warriors, that are finally coming home
I wanna go where the dead are raised
Where the mountain lion lays down with the lamb
I wanna stand where God is praised
I wanna ride across the plains to the promised land
[Chorus]
Where I'm going don't need to raise your voice
No starvation, have plenty to eat
No guns, no wars, no hateful noise
Just a victory dance, we'll never taste defeat
Where there's nothin' done or said that can't be forgiven
Where every step you take is on sacred ground
Walk away from death into the land of the living
Where all the lost tribes are finally found

They took old Geronimo by storm
Ripped off the feathers from his uniform

He said the red man is in the sun set too
They stole his land, now they won't give it back
And they sent Geronimo a cadillac

When someone breaks your heart, you cry your eyes red

As far as I can see there's no reason for goodbye
You're just runnin' scared and that's something I won't buy

The fires of rage begin to burn
You can't go home and he can't go on
His flesh is weak and his spirits gone
Now he's behind a prison wall
He doesn't have the will to live
He says it's all his father's fault
He taught his son the way to live
He was unable to forgive
She wore his ring for thirty years
And one night he confessed his darkest fears
He'd been unfaithful, he'd been untrue
What could she say, what could she do?
No where to run, no where to turn
The fires of rage begin to burn
She can't go home and she can't go on
Her flesh is weak and her spirits gone
He had betrayed her with a kiss
Killed her desires, her will to live
And who was blinded, what did they miss?
Will she be able to forgive? Are we able to forgive?

A stolen car, a broken dream
Blood on his hands and it won't come clean"

These evil ways they will not last
Someday their souls will be set free
And their voices will be heard
As far as every eye can see
They will have the final word
For every weed in every garden
And all the crops that ever died
While you were full and they were starvin',
My children will not de denied
Every fire that you have started
Every fist you threw my way
For all the families you have parted
The innocent will have their day.
Someday their should will be set free

So many trails we left behind
So many songs that I forget

The little secrets we both know
How I held you when you slept
I've always felt the tears you wept
There is a reason for your laughter
There is a reason for your pain
There is a dream you're chasing after
There are some things you'll (we'll) never change
So many rivers we have crossed
The love we found the love we lost
The steps we made I will retrace
The broken memories can't erase"
"1274" "Clyde woke up real early while Edna was still asleep
Got dressed and had some coffee, then found his set of keys
He pulled on his levi jacket, he headed for the door
The kitchen smelled like dinner from the night before
A rumbling exhaust pipe woke Edna from her sleep
She stumbled like a drunkard yelling Clyde you wait for me
But Clyde was going nowhere, just sitting in his truck
Staring with a poker face, like he'd run out of luck
CHORUS:
Cause any fool would've turned and run
Any fool would've walked away
Any fool would've given up
But an ordinary man, he chose to stay
Now Edna, she couldn't say too much, she'd seen that look before
She kept tapping on Clyde's window, till he opened up the door
Then she put her arms around him, she never said a word
And Clyde turned on the radio and neither of them heard
He said Edna why don't you hop in, I think I'll call in sick
There's three one ways to a dead end street, now you just take your pick
And she pointed to the ballfield and the park where they first kissed
And Clyde grinned like he found something that he had almost missed
CHORUS
They spent that day in freedom, they hung on for many more
Raised up quite a family, they found what love was for
And the aging never slowed them down, they leaned on faith, not luck
Still out taking Sunday drives in Clyde's old beat up truck
You know Edna, she ain't no movie star and Clyde's a little slow
The shopping mall's replaced the park where they both used to go
But that's why they've both got each other, so they can keep their dreams alive
The simple dreams, the common man, still stand the test of time

Talkin' suicide with an old friend of mine
They gathered a crowd down at the end of the tracks
And a woman cried out, \"When is God comin' back?\"
And they pretended not to notice
They came down hard on the weak
Causing war and starvation
Refusing to let them speak
For every mountain I climb
For every river that winds
For every wind that will blow
I will send out my prayers
To the children below
I saw a crazy horse walkin' alone in the dark
On the streets paved in blood, on his broken heart
He never dreamed it would turn out like this
They pretend that they just don't see
They are blinded with their own mediocrity
They got their trophies and their cars
Big houses on the hill and they don't really care
That their wars are a killin' me
For every child that follows the dream
With ten thousand angels fly
No one will force them to run
They will stand up and fight till this battle is won
For every mountain I climb
For every river that winds
For every wind that will blow
I will send out my prayers
To the children below
For every mountain I climb
For every river that winds
For every wind that will blow
I will send out my prayers
To the children below
For every mountain I climb
For every river that winds"

And sound of horses thundering they echoed once again

On down that street through a long alley way
And the tears won't come
Cause there way inside
Somebody say a prayer
For the orphan child
Just nineteen but she looks much older than that
Pulling tricks down the avanue and shes working the streets at night like a cat
And the men she meets, their all the same
They don't even want to know her real name
When the morning sun is on the rise
She will sigh and call it a night
Just another fatherless one
And it nobody turns her around
She live and die in the streets of this town
And her tears won't come
Cause there way inside

I still got my memories of the night we jumped the fence
Stole you uncle's pickup truck, drove it up around the bend
You were the handsome cowboy, I the trusty brave
We were looking for some fallen angel waiting to be saved
Well for some it just comes so easy
For others seems its bread in the bones
But we danced to the beat of a different drum
Then the one we heard at home
I went to the mountains, I was reaching for the sun
I was on fire for leaving, this angry battle I thought I'd won
David dug his trenches, he fought his war at home
My mountain soon was crumbling, God I was all alone
Well for some it just comes so easy
And for others its bread in their bones
But I danced to the beat of a different drum
Then the one I heard at home
It was years before the smoke cleared, I could come back home again
Look my father in the eyes, I could finally let him in
For he was not the enemy, no the enemy was within
And I knew the day they understood because David was my friend
Well for some you know it comes so easy

Her legs are short and twisted not straight and tall
She learned when she was young how to deal with the rejection
Cast into a world with all it standards of perfection
Most people looked away with a downward glance
And as a beautiful young woman, she was never asked to dance
Her dreams were just as lofty as the girl next door
And she remember what her father said when she couldn't take no more
He said

You will run and never grow tired
You'll become a new creation
If you just keep the faith of a child,
Keep the faith of a child

In a one room apartment at sixth and brown
She's got a steady job well its all right for now
She has plans for moving on if she can make it some how
Her brown hands are folded as she bows her head to pray
Over doughnuts and some coffee she made up yesterday
Her mind begins to travel, she gives thanks to the lord
And a angel stands beside her, points out to the door
And said
Today you going to soar like a eagle
You will run and never grow tired
You've become a new creation
For you have kept the faith of a child
Kept the faith of a child, kept the faith of a child"
"1294" "With the wings of sorrow, I have taken flight
Cloaked in the darkness like a thief in the night
I have watched the farmer planting in his field
And known that what he sows, is there for me to steal
I take what I need, never more, never more
In the art of survival, there's no rich there's no poor
Time passes by, kingdoms come and go
I've seen it all, I'm a raven in the snow
I have watched the seekers searching for their gold
The rape of the land, generations unfold
Nations of the world, their rise and their fall
I've watched it all, I'm a raven in the snow
I have heard the crying, wailing in the wind
Empty words and broken promises, time and time again
Song of the sparrow, call of the crow
Echo in the mountain and the valley's below
The scarecrow and the hunter, can't keep me away
The winter winds a blowin' couldn't lead me astray
You can separate the flock still my colors would show
I will stand out, like a raven in the snow"
"1295" "I've got you under my skin
I have got you, deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I'd tried so, not to give in
And I said to myself this affair it never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when baby I know so well
That I've got you under my skin
I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear
Don't you know, you fool
You never can win
Use your mentality
Wake up to reality
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice comes in the night
And repeats how it yells in my ear
Don't you know, you fool
That ain't no just win
Why not use your mentality
Wake up, step up to reality
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Because I've got you under my skin
Yea, you grab me under my skin"

There's a path through the wilderness
You'll have to find
Those earthly possessions
You must leave behind

The rich man owns rivers of gold
Don't know what it's worth
The meek and the purest of heart
Will inherit the earth

A horse you must ride

"1297" "Like two dogs on an open road
Like two flowers on an old gravestone
Like two leaves tumblin' in the wind
I'm searchin' for a beginning that has no end
And I'm rollin' with the thunder
Still waitin' for the rain
Rollin' with the thunder
Still waitin' for the rain
Like two boots in a salvation army store
Like two sailors out lookin' for a whore
Two broken windows in a burned out van
I'm a fugitive lookin' for a
One-armed man
Two rings in an old pawn shop
Two dusty winos cussin' out a cop
Two tumbleweeds blowin' across the plain
We're all dry seeds just waitin' for the rain"

"1299" "I've sen a thousand starry nights
Caught glimpse of the moon
Romantic words by candlelight
They ended all too soon
All these roads that I've been down
And the faces that I've seen
I made my way from town to town
One step behind my dreams
And I've seen the way
Hearts can go astray
And the damage it can do
And my mind's made up
That no matter what
No one else will do
No one else but you
Sometimes fools will rush right in
And promises are made
But like whispers in the wind
Their words just fade away
And so on and on we go
Till someone comes along
Who can make this half seem whole
And make this heart beat strong
'Cause I've seen the way
Hearts can go astray
And the damage they can do
But my mind's made up
That no matter what
No one else will do
No one else but you"
"1300" "I heard a voice callin' out to me
Might've been a vision might've been a dream
It said some things will come and some will go
We're only here a moment don't you know
I don't claim to have all the answers
And I've got my share of questions
But if I don't follow blindly
It doesn't mean I've lost my way
I'm still on the journey
Headed down the road less traveled
I guess we're all gonna get there
In our own time and way
there's a bridge that leads to the other side
You'll know you've crossed when you arrive
Everyone will have a tale to tell
I'm gonna quench my thirst when I drink from that well"
"1301" "The last fall of the morning rain drips off the wino's shoes
He's sleeping in a cardboard tent too drunk to know its through
But the rainbow from this morning sun can't be too far behind
Down his alley where the sun won't shine the blind must lead the blind
Ten stories up the boy looks out his face pressed to the screen
He heard the thunder rolling in it woke him from his dream
And his mother's calling out to him boy get up and make your bed
But that kid's a thousand miles away hasn't heard a word she said
CHORUS:
But as long as the grass will grow
In the cracks of the sidewalk
Next to the old lampposts
As long as the birds will fly
In the thick broken air against a highrise sky
Then the morning sun will shed it's light
On the city down below
Inside a cab, the driver yawns, he's worked an all night shift
He sets his meter one last time before he call it quits
The heartbeat of the homeless still echoes in the streets
They're all wrapped in coats and blankets don't have enough to eat"

I swear I heard the crys of the innocent victims in the wind at wounded knee
Theres a trail of tears we could follow, can you hear the footsteps of the Cherokee
Its a trail of broken promises, will you walk this trail with me
We can find america down the trail of freedom
Walk the way of my fathers from sea to sea
Oh can you find america, hear the drums of freedom
Gonna find it together, walk this trail
Walk the trail with me
I felt the Chipawa wind off Lake Michigan on a cold Chicago day
I heard the thunder of the Seminoles, way down in the everglades
And I've seen it in the beauty of a Navaho girl, like a flower in the desert heat
And I've felt it in the pride of a Cheyene dancer, as he moved to an ancient beat
Oh can you find america down the trail of freedom
Walk the way of my fathers from sea to sea
Yeah we can find america, hear drums of freedom
Gonna find it together, walk this trail
Walk the trail with me
I walk the streets of Gallup, New Mexico on a saturday night
I watched my brothers fall to the alcohol, we were going down without a fight
Hey brothers, we must walk with the pride of Cheif Joseph, have the courage of Geronimo
For this trail its long, so you have to be strong, just to find your way back home
We can find america down the trail of freedom
Walk the way of my fathers from sea to sea
Oh can you find america, hear the drums of freedom
Gonna find it together, walk this trail
Walk the trail with me"
"1307" "Old pictures kept in a tattered cardboard box
And after church on Sunday it was a crazy thing to watch
How we'd gather 'round the table like pieces of a puzzle that didn't fit
I don't believe there was one memory that my momma could not relive
She has old dreams and new hopes
Worn out quilts and jump ropes from days gone by
She has old dreams and new hopes
Cold hands, warm heart and a faith that just won't die
When everyone had gone to bed, my dad was in the kitchen eatin' pie
He's listening to his radio, I don't believe I ever saw my daddy cry
Put behind his days of drinkin', but I do believe that the bottle took its toll
Now he needs his nights for thinkin' cause his heart just can't admit he's growing old
He has old dreams and new hopes
Worn out books and a pack of smokes to get him by
He has old dreams and new hopes
Good jokes, strong coffee and a heart that just won't die
I can see him in the kitchen fast asleep with the morning coming on
And my momma's sleeping peacfully with her crucifix and her pictures all around
She'll be up before he notices making eggs and bacon for his day
He'll warm up his cup of coffee, get a hug and be on his way
They have old dreams and new hopes
Nine children and a house in the woods to get them by
They have old dreams and new hopes
Faced the hard times together with a love that just won't die
No, it just won't die
Just won't die"

"1309" "A boy heard the voice of the whippoorwill one night
and went out to find where he was singing. He had to
walk quite a ways through a big field, because the
song of the whippoorwill carried so well in the wind he
sound much closer then he really was. And on the way
the boy found a well worn trail, so he stayed on it for a
while. And sitting in the middle of the trail was coyote,
and coyote was singing too. He turned and saw the
boy and he said \"Why are you follow me?\" The boy
was frightened and said \"Well the trail you made
happened to be a short and easy way through this
field. Then coyote asked \"Well if your not following
me then why are you here?\" \"Well I heard the beautiful
song of the whippoorwill and wanted to watch him
sing.\" \"Well do you not think my songs are beautiful?\",
said coyote. \"Oh\", said the boy, \"there good but I hear
you all the time. I much prefer the songs of the
whippoorwill\" This made coyote furious and he was
jealous of the whippoorwill's song. He said \"Listen to
my night song you might like this one\" And he pulled
back his head and yodeled out a tune. The boy
covered his ears and politely said, \"Thank you for the
song, but I must be going now.\" \"Well\", coyote said, \"I
can show you a short cut to the whippoorwill boy, and
where he sings is just over there.\" Pointing his claw,
smiling out of the side of his mouth. The boy paused,
looked around, he knew the night was passing fast so
he agreed to follow coyote. But coyote's trail was
rough and rocky. And the boy fell in quite a few
gopher holes along the way. Coyote turned around
and laughed and he yelled to the boy. \"Were almost
there, hurry up.\" Coyote was at a full trot but the boy
had just fallen again and hurt his knee. And by the time
he got to the place where the whippoorwill had been
singing all night, it was morning. Whippoorwill was
gone. And so was coyote, in fact he could hear
coyote's songs in another field. So the boy turned and
headed for home, covered with burrs, misq bites and a
skinned up knee. And it was many summers later
when the boy became a wiser man. And he realized,
there are no shortcuts to find something you really
love. But there are many trails in this life. So you must
stay true to your path, and always keep and eye out
for coyote"

Why this should happen and why you just disappearing?

So why this should happen and why you just disappearing
Am I just the one who feel not right or am I just want to see you now
So please just make it warm, cause Im freezing here
Evening in the avenue and watch a thrilling movie with you
But now this night seems like better now
You just fill my boredom with much laugh

"1323" "Oh the buzzin' of the bees in the cigarette trees
The soda water fountain where the lemonade springs
And the bluebird sings in that Big Rock Candy Mountain
On a summer day
In the month of May
A burly bum came ahiking
Down a shady lane
Through the sugar cane
He was looking for his liking
As he strolled along
He sang a song
Of the land of milk and honey
Where a bum can stay
For many a day
And he won't need any money
Oh the buzzin' of the bees in the cigarette trees
The soda water fountain where the lemonade springs
And the bluebird sings in that Big Rock Candy Mountain
In the Big Rock Candy Mountain
The cops have wooden legs
The bulldogs all have rubber teeth
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs
The farmers' trees are full of fruit
The barns are full of hay
I want to go where there ain't no snow
Where the sleet don't fall and the wind don't blow
In that Big Rock Candy Mountain
There's a lake of gin
We can both jump in
And the handouts grow on bushes
In the new-mown hay
We can sleep all day
And the bars all have free lunches
Where the mail train stops
And there ain't no cops
And the folks are tender-hearted
Where you never change your socks
And you never throw rocks
And your hair is never parted
Oh the buzzin' of the bees in the cigarette trees
The soda water fountain where the lemonade springs
And the bluebird sings in that Big Rock Candy Mountain
Oh, a farmer and his son,
They were on the run
To the hay field they were bounding
Said the bum to the son,
\"Why don't you come
To that big rock candy mountain?\"
So the very next day
They hiked away,
The mileposts they were counting
But they never arrived
At the lemonade tide
On the big rock candy mountain
Oh the buzzin' of the bees in the cigarette trees
The soda water fountain where the lemonade springs
And the bluebird sings in that Big Rock Candy Mountain
1. One evening as the sun went down
And the jungle fires were burning,
Down the track came a hobo hiking,
He said, \"Boys, I'm not turning
I'm heading for a land that's far away
Beside the crystal fountain
I'll see you all this coming fall
In the Big Rock Candy Mountain
Chorus:
In the Big Rock Candy Mountain,
It's a land that's fair and bright,
The handouts grow on bushes
And you sleep out every night.
The boxcars all are empty
And the sun shines every day
I'm bound to go
Where there ain't no snow
Where the sleet don't fall
And the winds don't blow
In the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
Chorus:
3. In the Big Rock Candy Mountain
You never change your socks
And little streams of alkyhol
Come trickling down the rocks
O the shacks all have to tip their hats
And the railway bulls are blind
There's a lake of stew
And ginger ale too
And you can paddle
All around it in a big canoe
In the Big Rock Candy Mountain
Oh the buzzin' of the bees in the cigarette trees
The soda water fountain where the lemonade springs
And the bluebird sings in that Big Rock Candy Mountain
In the Big Rock Candy Mountain
The cops have wooden legs
The bulldogs all have rubber teeth
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs
The box-cars all are empty
And the sun shines every day
I'm bound to go
Where there ain't no snow
Where the sleet don't fall
And the winds don't blow
In the Big Rock Candy Mountain.
Oh the buzzin' of the bees in the cigarette trees
The soda water fountain where the lemonade springs
And the bluebird sings in that Big Rock Candy Mountain
In the Big Rock Candy Mountain,
The jails are made of tin.
You can slip right out again,
As soon as they put you in.
There ain't no short-handled shovels,
No axes, saws nor picks,
I'm bound to stay
Where you sleep all day,
Where they hung the jerk
That invented work
In the Big Rock Candy Mountain.

Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good will to men.

A voice, a chime, a chant sublime

Of peace on earth, good will to men.\""

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

no turning to left or to right

or there'll be a hanging tonight
one hour ahead of the posse
no time for remorse or regret
but somehow her eyes still haunt me
her laughter is taunting me yet
it started the night that we might
she kissed me and vowed she would care
I traded the gold in pocket
to fondle the curls in her hair
she lied when she told me she loved me
she lied with each kiss that she gave
she lied to the moment I caught her
and now she lies still in her grave
on hour ahead of the posse
the night is a-coming on fast
we must win the race to the rio
and well shake that old posse at last

"1357" "There was a little railroad train with loads and loads of toys
All starting out to find a home with little girls and boys
And as that little railroad train began to chug along
The little engine up in front was heard to sing this song
Choo choo, choo choo, choo choo, choo choo, I feel so good today
Oh, clear the track, oh clickety clack, I?ll go my merry way
The little train went roaring on, so fast, it seemed to fly
Until it reached a mountain rising almost to the sky
The little engine moaned and groaned and huffed and puffed away
But halfway to the top it just gave up and seemed to say
I can't go on, I can't go on, I'm weary as can be
I can't go on, I can't go on, this job is not for me
The toys got out to push but all in vain alas, alack
And then a great big engine came a whistling down the track
They asked if it would kindly pull them up the mountain side
But with a high and mighty sneer it scornfully replied
don't bother me, don't bother me to pull the likes of you
Don't bother me, don't bother me, I've better things to do
The toys all started crying ?cause that engine was so mean
And then there came another one, the smallest ever seen
But though it seemed that she could hardly pull herself along
She hitched on to the train and as she pulled she sang this song
I think I can, I think I can, I think I have a plan
And I can do 'most anything if I only think I can
Then up that great big mountain with the cars all full of toys
And soon they reached the waiting arms of happy girls and boy
And though that ends the story it will do you lots of good
To take a lesson from the little engine that could
Just think you can, just think you can, just have that understood
And very soon you'll start to say, I always knew I could
I knew I could, I knew I could, I knew I could

But a false hearted lover will lead you to the grave
And the grave will decay you and turn you to dust
Not one girl in a hundred a poor boy can trust
They'll hug you and kiss you and tell you more lies
Than cross lines on a railroad or stars in the skies
So come all your maidens and listen to me
Never place your affections on a green willow tree
For the leaves they will wither and the roots they will die
You'll all be forsaken and never know why."
"1366" "Sitting by the roadside on a summer's day
Chatting with my mess-mates, passing time away
Laying in the shadows underneath the trees
Goodness how delicious eating goober peas
Peas, peas, peas, peas
Eating goober peas
Goodness how delicious
Eating goober peas
When a horse-man passes, the soldiers have a rule
To cry out at their loudest, \"Mister, here's your mule?\"
But another pleasure enchanting-er than these
Is wearing out your grinders, eating goober peas
Peas, peas, peas, peas
Eating goober peas
Is wearing out your grinders
Eating goober peas
Just before the battle, the General hears a row
He said, \"The Yanks are coming, I hear their rifles now\"
He turns around in wonder and what do you think he sees?
The Georgia Militia eating goober peas
Peas, peas, peas, peas
Eating goober peas
The Georgia Militia
Eating goober peas
I think my song has lasted almost long enough
The subject's interesting but the rhymes are mighty tough
I wish this war was over and free from rags and fleas
We'd kiss our wives and sweethearts, and gobble goober peas
Peas, peas, peas, peas
Gobble goober peas
We'd kiss our wives and sweethearts
And gobble goober peas"

It's just my funny way of laughin'
Yes, my funny way of laughin'
Your leavin' didn't bother me
It's just my funny way of laughin'
Yes, my funny way of laughin'
I'm really happy as can be
If you see me with a great big smile
At some party where the fun runs wild
If tears start to flow and I fall apart
Please don't think you broke my heart
[Chorus]
If we meet on the street
And a little bitta tear rolls down my cheek
Please don't think it's because I'm blue
Or that I'm still in love with you
[Chorus]
Remember the day you left our place
And how the tears rolled down my face
It wasn't because you were leavin' me
I was happy because you were pleasing me

And shoeing the bones for evryone.
And these are hard times to fall in love

Oh I fell upon a hard hard mile
Shoed me some bones to stake my time

Shoeing the bones for evryone.

Sent toward him tender drift
And on the worst day of his life
Hed still love more things than I like

I packed you up with trophy bones
And bridged you on the peak
We stayed to watch the ships come in

Locked in prison cells
Send some to the lonely seniors
Trapped in apartment hells
Send some to the weary miners
Sweating beneath the ground
Send some to the invisible people
Hauling our garbage round
Some answers in life are so easy
Like zero plus zero is none
But how do we divide the smell of flowers
So their fragrance is shared by everyone?
If I could divide the smell of flowers
Id pass some to the frightened animals
Caged against their wills
Pass some to the dying birds
Choking on oil spills
Pass some to the angry kids
Sniffing up airplane glue
Pass some to the crying widow
Missing the Love she knew
Some answers in life are so easy
Like zero plus zero is none

Mates who kept their faith in me
Guys who always handed me the crown

Warriors who beat the drums
When we would fight the fight
My lover can bathe me in her naked tender core
Provide a warm place in which to hide
But when its time for war
Time for blood
I need my soldiers by my side
My lover can soothe me in her deep warm soul
Perfume away all my misery
But when its time to roll
Time for guns
I need my soldiers backing me

Losses seem more intense
Early mornings feel the worst
When I really miss my old friends

Playing on a swing
Deep in love with life
Loving everything
And he'd speak to God
When all alone
Making deals with God
'Bout his dreams and hopes
When the night would fall
And he'd lie in bed
Listening to the tunes
Playing in his head

Prayed to God up high

Makes the whole world cry
Let me write a song
So tender, sad, and sweet
The kind of song
Drops men to their knees\"
Nowhere near a man
He didn't understand.....
That to write a song
Makes the whole world cry
Have to hold the hand
Of a friend who dies
Hear your brother curse your name
Watch your mother fade away
While crooks steal your gold
Suffer years being alone
Nowhere near a man
He didn't understand....
That to write a song
Makes the whole world cry
Have to fall in love
Then be denied
Meet hopeless kids
Raised in cruel neglect
Hear animals scream
Tortured half to death
There was a Boy
Prayed to God up high
\"Let me write a song
Makes the whole world cry
Let me write a song
Tender, sad, and sweet
The kind of song
Drops men to their knees\"
If I could reach that boy
Before it gets too late
Warn him there are wishes
You should never make
But that boy was me
And it's far too late
Wrote this song in tears
Wrote this song in pain
And now I'm a man
And now I understand
So torn up inside
Just want to cry
I want to cry...cry...cry
Oh, God, I want to cry
I want to cry"

Twenty years ago
Never felt the pain
Never felt the awe
Twenty years ago
Never felt my shame
Never knew my flaws
Theres nothing I can write today
I could have written way back then
Nothing I can write today
Could be written with a younger pen
And I ask....
Baby , am I too late?
Tell me baby, Tell me now
Baby, writing songs is all I've ever wanted to do"

In that rain-soaked night

On your baby breath
Lift this wounded flag
Into your burning nest

I will

Your field is ripe
Bury my torn body
In that rain-soaked night
Tame the roaring tiger
Never lets you rest
Take my last reward
From your moonlit breasts
Oh, yes, I will
I will
Daddys gone hunting
Hes gone away
Daddys gone hunting
Wont be back for days
Left you with a lover
Makes a shrine
Of your skin
Left you with a lover
Takes you down
Roads of sin
Left you all alone
Alone
And the knots cut deep
Through the musk and flesh
Of hot regret
And the love you need
Its a shadow
Never lets you rest
You release the Beast
From a well thats wet
You will confess
That the love you need
Its a shadow
Never lets you rest

Aaaaaah......"

In a world
Sees everything
Everything, everything.but me
Invisible to your touch
And doubt youll like me very much
Am I alive?
Was I ever me?
Im a non-existent cipher
A pointless empty zero
Never added up to anything
A non-existent cipher
Pointless empty zero
Tell me.what does it all mean?
And now I think I want you
Ethereal body
Oblivious mask
And now I think I love you
Intelligent lips
Painted in black
But no need to look my way
Or give me the time of day
Cant be with you
In this world
Invisible man
Never gets the girl
Oh, no...
Ill find where you are
And watch from afar
You will be felt by me
Ill find where you are
And watch from afar
You will be loved by me

For life
Your zero
The day I die

And you....youll never know
Soulmates born together
The very best of friends
We were lovers on a distant planet
Well be lovers once again
Lovers after the twilight ends
And I wish you the best
A love thats truly blessed
And I cheer you on
Youre my favorite song
My eternal swan
Oh, I love you so
And you...youll never know
Soulmates born together
The very best of friends
We were lovers on a distant planet
Well be lovers once again
Lovers after the twilight ends
And when our lives are through
Bury me next to you
Well be lovers again
Lovers again
Again and again and again and again
Lovers after the twilight ends
Well be lovers again"

Feels like ice
Inside her lake
She's my Hallelujah
My Hallelujah
In our Land of

And no man
Could forget
The darkness in her eyes
No man could resist
The perfume of her mind
Build a pagan temple
From her naked holy skin
Live inside her spider
By the gods
Who dwell within
I have an evil lover
Rides my aching soul
Blocks the sun
From shining
In the desert
Where I grow
Wraps me in her scent
Stupefies my brain
Turns my nights
To hunger
For the feast that
She became
She's my Hallelujah
My Hallelujah
In our Land of
Na Na Na Na
She's my love
My tragic flaw
In our Land of
Na Na Na Na
My tragic flaw

Let her hear me cry
I couldnt bring myself to write it
Til this darkened day arrived
A song about old promises
Made so long ago
Created and cremated
Ashes of the words I spoke
Long separated by the miles
Distanced from her golden smiles
Memory of a mother
Shared my dreams and really cared
Long separated by the miles
Distanced from her golden smiles
Mama
I know I wasnt there...
For you
Would have placed
A magic carpet
neath your weak and shaky legs
Would have raised
A strong west wind
Let you breathe with ease again
Would have bribed
Gods venal angels
Come and soothe your endless pain
Would have vanquished
All the demons
And bring peace to you again
Be the child
I never knew
In a land
We wont grow old
Be the light
I always loved
Warmed my dark
And lonely soul
Be the girl
Playing games
In a world
The sun wont set
Be the laughter
Calms my heart
I never will forget
I wont forget, wont forget
This song is for my mother
Let her hear me cry
Couldnt bring myself to write it
Til this darkened day arrived

Made so long ago

Im broken
Drowning in the pain each day
Im drowningdrowning...drowningdrowning

"1433" "One night
We spoke of God
In a cloud of high blue smoke
At the first midnight stroke
One night
We spoke of God
Atop a steep quiet hill
We pondered our free will
One night
We spoke of God
Under tarry blackened sky
We wondered why
Why, oh, Why, oh, Why?
There are people in our lives
Who cause us pain
From whom we cannot flee
There are people in this world
Who would bring us sweet love
We can never hope to meet
One night
We spoke of God
Asking questions very strange
Is it all pre-arranged?
One night
We spoke of God
Under tarry blackened sky
We wondered why
Why, oh, Why, oh, Why?
We spoke of God
Got high on God
Cried About God
Tried to find God
We spoke of God
Got whacked on God
Mad about God
Sad about God
We spoke of God
Got crazed on God
Estranged from God
Afraid of God
God!"

And leads green lizards
To their grave
Now you can live forever
In air so hot
I can hardly breathe
Now you can live forever
Escaped my past
And found my peace
Now you can live forever
In dark deep caves
Where snakes grow big

How I want to live

And you will never see a house so bloody stunning

In the service of ingrates

And my spirit waned
Routine made me its slave
In the tomb I made

"1455" "I dream
I dream about you
I'll never forget
The heartbeats we shared
And still haven't met
An angel who cares
Dream...dream
I dream
I dream about you
In poppy seed fields
And warm cypress nights
Your head on my chest
Everything felt alright
Dream...dream
I want to dream
You're my dream
Be my dream
Won't you be my dream?
Never let you go"
"1456" "America....
After 9/11, the country seemed reborn
Ready to shift from the shallow to the profound
What ever happened to the America that could have been?
What ever happened to the America we deserve?
Step into my church
And pray
For a nation growing dumber
Every day
What ever happened to the heros
That should have been?
(I want to know)
Whatever happened to the stars
That should have shone?
(I want to know)
After the towers came a-tumbling down.
Don't care what you bought at the store
Got no interest in who you score
Give me stories of men and women
Who make the wheels turn
Do things I need to learn
Could care less about your marble floors
Show the Rolls to your greedy whores
GIve me hearts of men and women
Who save peoples' lives
Do things we need to prize
What ever happened to America?
People across America Unite
Times are urgent, we need to fight
The country's infrastructure is in a plight
Get the word to the people about whassup
Get the word that enough is enough
Roads are in ruin
Schools facing doom
Hospitals getting harder to find
Firestations closing down all the time
Honest policemen fading away
Caring nurses walking away
Shout the word all across the hood
Let's praise the people doing good
What ever happened to America?
Wasting too many hours discussing Pam Anderson's rack
Wasting too much time wondering if Michael's still black
TV's filled with junk and stupidities
Our seed's learning wrong priorities
We need more nurses and more burn wards
Fewer actors collecting dumb awards
Basketball players earning more than enough pay
Our fighting soldiers deserve one big raise
Let's put more money back into the roads
Less money going into BS reality shows
Teachers and nurses, firemen and police
Ambulance drivers, keepers of the peace
Shout the word all across the hood
Let's praise the people doing good
What ever happened to the stars
That should have shone
After the towers came a-tumbling down?
You don't know
As you watch the Media talk
You're strangled beneath
Their glamorous fog
I take this time
To remind you
Of the rampant course
A Man unleashed upon the world
With vindictive force
You took the time to estrange
The body and brain
Illuminati reigns
While some hottie's bling blocks
The Tellie's current affairs
Gotta change
Applaud arrange
With vision upon visions
While visions incisions
Gone missing for days
As this daze stays
Our school system strays
Heroes paid minimum wage
As stars achieve critical claim
For individual aims
This country's spirit takes
A visible wane
What ever happened to America?"
"1457" "She called herself London
On that day
She fell from the sky
Child of apple blossoms
Dancing wildly
Into your mind
The snake that hung from her neck
Bites your hand
Expels you from Eden
Tears into the cool flesh
Of your madness
Posing as reason
London
Kisses you like a sweet lover
As though she really cares
Lets you
Taste the passionate orchard
In her bodys secret lair
London
Wrestles with all your demons
Nothing quite compares
To the pain
The indecent pleasure
In the waters that you share
Her name was London
Call her London
She called herself London
On that night
She prayed to the moon
Apollos lyre
Played darkly
In a portent
Of your own doom
The hell she hides
In her soul
Toxic drug youll never escape
You crave the milk of her touch
Her strange and dangerous ways
London
Kisses you like a sweet lover
As though she really cares
Lets you
Taste the passionate orchard
In her bodys secret lair
London
Wrestles with all your demons
Nothing quite compares
To the pain
The indecent pleasure
In the waters that you share
Her name was London
Call her London
My baby, London
Call her London
My moon-girl, London
Call her London
I love her, London
Call her London
Forever, London

Taught you how to cheat and rape

In the green park ranger's truck,
he slowed down when he passed me up,
he said Central Park, says it might rain
And I learn another stranger's name
Late in the day
So how do you like your job I said,
He told me once it's no good
I lock up the playgrounds, here in the park
I am the bully of New York
Yeah I am the bully of New York
It's getting dark, so I turn the keys
Kids all think I'm being mean
It's not easy for me
Working nights, I'm never home
My love and I got divorced
Theres a path of light there in the leaves
I am a man down on my knees
Yeah, I am a man down on my knees
It's getting dark, so I turn the keys

Nothing's gonna stop me

Because some may praise you just to get what they want
And I said mama I am not afraid
They will take what they will take
And what would life be like without a few mistakes

for herself.
She never spoke of feeling sad.
Was, oh, so close with the family and friends
she had around her.
But she went quietly.
She didn't make a sound.
She went quietly
with the wish not to be found.
She went quietly
without a word of where.
Just a note that wrote:
\"Forgetting is easier.\"
Years have fallen since the day
she wrote the note and chose to float away
into the Ether.
Someone said they saw her south
at the coast on the river's mouth,
but only briefly.
'Cause she went quietly.
She didn't make a sound.
She went quietly

She went quietly

My whole life flashed in front of me, so suddenly
And sinking down I knew I still could hear your scream !
I hear you calling me
There's nothing I can do

With memories you spend all night playing hide and seek
Replaying how it should have been and could have been
If only there were omens that you could have seen
Back in that room again
You hope to reach me through a medium
But there is no use ; I can't reply to this lover's cry
Oh ! How I wish I just could see you
One more time to say goodbye.

But ever time she leaves me, refusing to believe me,
You're always there.

But it was just no use at all,
Cause every time I climbed inside your mind,
I saw the mirror on the wall.
But it's no use to pose the question,
When the answers never sheen,
And then I have to face up to the facts
With saxophones and old trombones carrying me home to say
Hello, alone, it's you and me again,
How can we pretend we've never met?
Hello alone you might as well come in,
We've been making bets for too long...
Perhaps I'll take a holiday,
And get as far away as I can,
But then I'd just be far away,
And just as a much a lonesome man,
With his hat in his hands chanting.

Pounded in the ground like railroad ties

Be thankful
Is sustenance the effect of work
Or is that an illusion?
The earth's carefree simplicity
Has led to my conclusion
I depend on my own hands
Put your title down
Everything you have is a gift
Put your title down

The nurturing of birds and trees
Is not of their own will
The Source providing all they need
Is nurturing me still

No I'm certain, out there
Out beyond the breakers
There's a land, green and fair
And one day I will see her

Putting messages in bottles
And trusting the sea

Oh, if I could just see your face at my door,

We're turning our eyes to some power above
We murmur the words of an act of contrition
Knowing so many weve lost and weve loved.

Wed raise up our glasses, and bid them a fond goodbye
Oh, if I could just see your face at my door,

But I've never found a quick way to cure...
Give me some time and as it goes by
I'll try to figure out what makes sense.
It seems to me that everything should come together in the end.
My conscience once asked me to always be kind,
I let her down but she's still here by my side.
Light me a fire, my hands are shaking,
they look like the moon.
A sweater is nice but a friendship is better
'cause it'll keep you through 'til June.
Oh, when we were kids there was so much to climb,
and we screwed up so many times, but at least we tried."

the night I met you
In that light I just knew
we'd be together
Something old, something new
I borrowed all that's true
And gave away the blue
Years gone longing for a kiss
and a touch of fire
Ended sweetly with a wish
and an angel choir
Love had never felt like this,
all roads open wide
To bring me home at night
I want to live a long time with you
Let me have a long time with you
I want to take a long time with you
Let's say we do
I know we'll have our trouble times,
stormy points of view
I'll be steady at your side
we'll walk right through
Copper, steel, pearls and wine
I promise you we'll fly
Right through that diamond sky
I want to live a long time with you

Let's say we do
Let's say we do, Let's say I do,

What are the chances this town won't wreck us?
There is a woman, there always is
She's standin' on the side of the stage
beckoning motionless
And my legs get weak
and my heart beats fast

was built to last
and my thoughts take off
where my hands want to go
and I know and I know and I know
Baby believe me
Baby believe me
I didn't do nothin'!
There's a strange black bird here
Which is mostly tall
makes a sound like an ambulance
That's her mating call
She sings a warning in the cold night air
she's out in the distance
she should be sleeping
but i can still hear her.
I'm steppin' out of a dream into a steamy car
and we huddle for safety at the cannibal bar
how far can I run away from this ring on my finger?
Is there a place where we can go to
shed our fear like clothes
and make love new?"

That's not enough - that's what you said
Love isn't dead, it's only hiding
And I know, we can find it inside
If we just let our hearts collide
So slow the road goes all around the moon and back
to light up the skin on your face
it's not my place but I'm standing here
it's clear the water rushes to the shore
and then recedes, like love when it bleeds
the deeper the needs

And I've got no secret agenda, no hidden plan."

Some day somebody's gonna make you want to Turn around and say goodbye
Until then baby are you going to let them
Hold you down and make you cry
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on for one more day
Things'll go your way
Hold on for one more day
I know that there is pain
But you hold on for one more day
Break free from the chains
I know that there is pain
But you hold on for one more day
Break free, break from the chains
Some day somebody's gonna make you want to
Turn around and say goodbye
Until then baby are you going to let them
Hold you down and make you cry
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Some day somebody's gonna make you want to Turn around and say goodbye
Until then baby are you going to let them
Hold you down and make you cry
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on for one more day
Things'll go your way
Hold on for one more day"
"1623" "The girl in the moon
Is alone with the stars
And the spaceships
The girl in the moon
Is alone and alive
With the dust and the air
Nothing grows
Everything is moving
But only goes in circles
And no one to talk to
Is reason enough to be blue
The girl in the moon
(We've been waiting to see)
With her dreams
(If this girl she will smile)
Has a steel melting smile
(Before she disappears)
But the girl with the blues
(You know we've been waiting here)
In the moon
(For such a long while)
Hasn't smiled in a long while
Nothing grows
Everything is moving
But only goes around her
And no one to sing to
Is reason enough to be
Blue, blue, blue x 4
The girl in the moon
With her dreams
Has a steel melting smile
But the girl with the blues
In the moon
Hasn't smiled in a long while
Blue, blue, blue x 4
Hey moon
Hey moon
We've been waiting to see
If this girl she will smile
You know we've been waiting
Here for such long while

I wanna get married
Wanna be Mrs. S-c-o-t-t

"1626" "Be safe and close darling
Your heart is precious to me
When you are exploring
Remember all you see
Is only the view of the world
From your flying machine
So distant you wander
You've lost your way it seems
Pretending you're happy
Nodoby else believes
You're ever going to come down
From your flying machine
These days you are keeping
Distinguished company
The blackbird, the robin
The tiny honeybees
I miss you my lover
You're gone through space and time
To search for another
Won't you come back and be mine?
Leave all the madness behind
From your flying machine
Everybody wants your magic elixir
Mix her and fix her
Oh, that's a trick, sir
Hold on to your hat
Watch out for black cats
All this bewitching has taken my lover away
Your heart is precious to me
When you are exploring
Remember all you see
Is only the view of the world
From your flying machine!"
"1627" "He's not eighteen, he's not twenty-five
He's closing in on forty, look at those eyes
He's searching for something, he can not describe
He's not unhappy, he's not satisfied
He falls in love with covers of slick magazines
With serious actresses on the screen
All are unattainable except in his dreams
Where his heart and his soul reside
'cause he is afraid of attainable love
Afraid it will envelop him, swallow him up
All of his life he has resisted the tug
Of attainable love, attainable love
His dance card is full, he's so much in demand
He get's nervous when his partners try to hold his hand
He's got to keep his options open, he's that kind of man
The girls he cha-cha's with never understand
They wonder if he's gay but the truth is he's not
He just won't settle for whatever it is he's got
They want to Tango, he want's to Fox Trot
Don't even think about the can can, he can't can't
'cause he is afraid of attainable love
Afraid it will envelop him, swallow him up
All of his life he has resisted the tug
Of attainable love, attainable love
Add me to the list of women
Who think you'll be different with me
Add me to the list of fools
Who flatly refuse to see that just like me
He is afraid of attainable love
Afraid it will envelop him, swallow him up
All of his life he has resisted the tug
Of attainable love, attainable
He is afraid of attainable love
Afraid it will envelop and swallow him up
All of his life he has resisted the tug
Of attainable love, attainable
All of his life he has resisted the tug
Of attainable love, attainable love
All of his life he has resisted the tug"
"1628" "Oh, Johnny and Janie, they were the perfect married couple
But not in bed
Oh, they tried taking drugs, How-To books, even Dr. Ruth
But for all intents and purposes their love life was dead
'Til one day Janie went over to the Pink Pussycat Boutique
She bought a long cylindrical thing
Now Janie is smiling, Johnny is not
Every night you can hear him sing
He says, \"Our love is bein' kept alive by artificial means
You've grown emotionally attached to that little pink machine
Our relationship is not as healthy as it seems
'Cause our love is being kept alive by artificial means''
Oh, Johnny went down to the barroom
He bought one drink, he bought two, he bought three
Oh, he moaned to the bartender, the state of his married life
Bartender said, \"Hey Bud, just listen to me''
So Johnny went over to the Pink Pussycat Boutique
He bought a plastic blow-up doll
Now Johnny is smiling, Janie is not
She is angry, she is jealous, she's appalled
She says, \"Our love is bein' kept alive by artificial means
You've grown emotionally attached to that poly-ethylene
Our relationship is not as healthy as it seems
'Cause our love is being kept alive by artificial means''

Plastic
(Plastic)
Tufts of artificial hair
Who'd ever think they could replace the love
(Love)
Humans used to share?
(Humans used to, humans used to)
(Humans used to, humans used to)
Then one fateful day those batteries died
At the same moment that, that big doll sprung a leak
Johnny looked at Janie looked at Johnny looked at Janie
Oh, they both found it difficult to speak
I wish I could say they threw those contraptions away
And fell in love all over again
But Johnny taped up that hissing woman
When Janie stole the batteries from his Sony Walkman
Because their love is bein kept alive by artificial means
They've grown emotionally attached to those modern sex machines
Their relationship is not as healthy as it seems
'Cause their love is being kept alive, love is being kept alive
Love is being kept alive by artificial means"

"1630" "I'm getting dizzy way up here I haven't been this high in years
Oh, whatever possessed me to
Blow eighty dollars on these high heel shoes
Looks like a pump, feels like a sneaker?
Do they think we're idiots? But I bought 'em
Now I'm standing in a subway car
I ride because I cannot walk far
I couldn't find an empty cab on the street
They were filled with high-heeled women with non-functioning feet
Twenty-six years ago I dreamed of wearing shoes like these
Oh, the warped mind of the preteen with her strange priorities
But this is a nightmare
Of unsteady ankles, hands waving in the air
But the looks my legs
Are getting from that man across the aisle
Almost make the pain and misery
And doctor bills worthwhile
If by chance you happen to meet
This wobbly woman walking down your street
The click of high heels on concrete
Is not the thrill of victory, it's the agony of defeat
Oh! Look at me everybody I learned this from Paula Abdul
Oh, take pity on my vanity, maybe question my sanity
Why I wear these uncomfortable things? Heaven knows
Which make me wonder about these pierced earrings
And my pantyhose, my control top
Ooh, I can see you don't want me to sing about pantyhose
You'd rather I go back to tap dancing
Like my close personal friend Paula Abdul
Who, like me, was a geek back in high school
Oh, I'm sorry, but that's not what this song is about
At least it wasn't when it started out
I pray this subway ride never ends
So I will never never have to walk again
In high heels, it's a different atmosphere
In high heels, I can see your house from here
In high heels, high heels"

A million minuscule decisions in a line
Why they brought us to this moment isn't clear
But that's all right, we've got all night
Could it be that the many roads
You took to get here
Were just for me to tell this story
And for you to hear this song
And your many hopes
And your many fears
Were meant to bring you here all along
So if you'll trust me with your time I'll spend it wisely
I will sing to you with all I have to give
If you traveled all this way, then I will do my best to play
My biggest hits (that don't exist)
And if you'll lend to me your ear I'll sing 'em pretty
I will never, ever sing 'em out of tune
And I will not forget the words,
of any chorus, bridge, or verse
I promise you
CHORUS
We've got Benjamin to play that old piano
If we're lucky it's a little out of tune
We've got Andy on the guitar 'cause I promised him
Some Texas barbecue

'Cause you sing to me a music of your own
As I cast out all these lines, so afraid that I will find
I am alone, all alone

"1635" "I grew up in a little town
A southern mix of lost and found
Where most folks seem to stick around
But I could hear the highway song
I'd sit out on the dock till dawn
And dream about the great beyond
(I dreamed that I was)
A world traveler
Set me loose to find my way
Just get me out on the road someday
With my sails unfurled
So many mysteries
I wanted to unravel
If I could travel the world
Soon enough I had my way
I saw the world the Lord has made
Mostly from the interstate
But I had hardly seen a thing
Until I gave a golden ring
To the one who gave her heart to me
(And I became)
A world traveler
That's the day I hit the road
'Cause I walked the hills of the human soul
Of a tender girl
I'm a world traveler
She opened the gate and took my hand
And led me into the mystic land
Where her galaxies swirl
So many mysteries
I never will unravel
I want to travel the world
Take a left at the end of my street
Just a few doors down
Up the hill and into the trees
There's a hole in the ground
Where we traveled the caverns so deep
We wandered the wonders so wide
It was right beneath our feet
All this time, all this time
Tonight I saw the children in their rooms
Little flowers all in bloom
Burning suns and silver moon
And somehow in that starry sky
The image of the Maker lies
Right here beneath my roof tonight
(So hold on tight, I'm a)
World traveler
Pack yours bags and dig down deep
Let's ride the storms and sail the seas
To the distant pole
I'm a world traveler
Into these uncharted lands
To blaze a trail in the vast expanse
Of the heart and soul
In the grace of the God of peace
Let's wade into the battle
Come on, come on with me
And get up in that saddle
There's a million mysteries
I never will unravel
Come on, let's travel the world"
"1636" "I was nineteen, you were twenty-one
The year we got engaged
Everyone said we were much too young
But we did it anyway
We bought our rings for forty each
From a pawn shop down the road
We said our vows and took the leap
Now fifteen years ago
We went dancing in the minefields
We went sailing in the storm
And it was harder than we dreamed
But I believe that's what the promise is for
\"I do\" are the two most famous last words
The beginning of the end
But to lose your life for another I've heard
Is a good place to begin
'Cause the only way to find your life
Is to lay your own life down
And I believe it's an easy price
For the life that we have found
And we're dancing in the minefields
We're sailing in the storm
This is harder than we dreamed
But I believe that's what the promise is for
So when I lose my way, find me
When I loose love's chains, bind me
At the end of all my faith, till the end of all my days
When I forget my name, remind me
'Cause we bear the light of the Son of Man
So there's nothing left to fear
So I'll walk with you in the shadowlands
Till the shadows disappear
'Cause he promised not to leave us
And his promises are true
So in the face of all this chaos, baby,
I can dance with you"
"1637" "I can see the storm descending on the hill tonight
Tall trees are bending to your will tonight
Let the mighty bow down
At the thundering sound of your voice
I can hear the howling wind and feel the rain tonight
Every drop a prophet in your name tonight
And the words that they sing
They are washing me clean, but
How long until this curtain is lifted?
How long is this the song that we sing?
How long until the reckoning?
And I know you hear the cries of every soul tonight
You see the teardrops as they roll tonight
Down the faces of saints
Who grow weary and faint in your fields
And the wicked roam the cities and the streets tonight
But when the God of love and thunder speaks tonight
Down the faces of saints
Who grow weary and faint in your fields
And the wicked roam the cities and the streets tonight
But when the God of love and thunder speaks tonight
I believe You will come
Your justice be done, but how long?
You are holiness and grace
You are fury and rest
You are anger and love
You curse and you bless
You are mighty and weak
You are silence and song
You are plain as the day,
But you have hidden your face--
For how long? How long?
And I am standing in the stillness of the reckoning
The storm is past and rest is beckoning
Mighty God, how I fear you
How I long to be near you, O Lord
How long until the burden is lifted?
How long is this the song that we sing?
How long until the reckoning?
And I know that I don't know what I'm asking
But I long to look you full in the face
I am ready for the reckoning"
"1638" "We chose the spot, we dug the hole
We laid the maples in the ground to have and hold
As Autumn falls to Winters sleep
We pray that somehow in the Spring
The roots grow deep
And many years from now
Long after we are gone
These trees will spread their branches out
And bless the dawn
He took a plane to Africa
He gathered up into his arms
An orphan son
So many years from now
Long after we are gone
This tree will spread its branches out
And bless the dawn
So sit down and write that letter
Sign up and join the fight
Sink in to all that matters
Step out into the light
Let go of all that's passing
Lift up the least of these
Lean into something lasting
Planting trees
She rises up as morning breaks
She moves among these rooms alone
Before we wake
And her heart is so full; it overflows
She waters us with love and the children grow
So many years from now
Long after we are gone
These trees will spread their branches out
And bless the dawn
These trees will spread their branches out
And bless someone"
"1639" "I am weary with the pain of Jacob's wrestling
In the darkness with the Fear, in the darkness with the Fear
But he met the morning wounded with a blessing
So in the night my hope lives on
When Elisha woke surrounded by the forces
Of the enemies of God, the enemies of God
He saw the hills aflame with angels on their horses
So in the night my hope lives on
I see the slave that toils beneath the yoke unyielding
And I can hear the captive groan, hear the captive groan
For some hand to stay the whip his foe is wielding
Still in the night my hope lives on
I see the armies of the enemy approaching
And the people driven, trembling, to the shore
But a doorway through the waters now is opening
So in the night my hope lives on
Like the son who thought he'd gone beyond forgiveness,
Too ashamed to lift his head--but if he could lift his head
He would see his father running from a distance
In the night my hope lives on
I can see the crowd of men retreating
As he stands between the woman and their stones
And if mercy in his holy heart is beating
Then in the night my hope lives on
I remember how they scorned the son of Mary
He was gentle as a lamb, gentle as a lamb
He was beaten, he was crucified, and buried
And in the night, my hope was gone
But the rulers of earth could not control Him
They did not take his life--he laid it down
All the chains of death could never hope to hold him
So in the night my hope lives on"
"1640" "God of my fathers
Huddled in the harbor
Every man an ocean from his home
Their captors could not keep them
When they heard the drums of freedom
The dream of a kingdom
In a land they've never known
And God of my fathers
Strangers in this country
Pilgrims on these dusty roads
Across the great plains
In the bellies of the steel trains
To stake a new claim
In that wilderness of hope
Like my fathers I am looking for a home
Looking for a home beyond the sea
So be my God and guide me
Till I lie beneath the hills
Then let the great God of my fathers
Be the great God of my children still
God of my grandfathers
Gone these many years now
I guess they're shining like the sun
And I envision them
Grinning at the finish
And they smile and they smile,
'Cause they love to see me run
CHORUS
Now we're counting stars and counting sand
Little feet and little hands
We're counting joys
We pray you'll know them
As you knew us when you wove us
As you hold us
Hold them, please hold them
Like their father, they are looking for a home
Looking for a home beyond the sea
So be their God and guide them
Till they lie beneath these hills
And let the great God of their father
Be the great God of their children,
Let the great God of my fathers
Be the great God of my children still"
"1641" "Why don't the mountains make me cry no more?
They don't sing the way they did before
They're just piles of stone
As dead as bones
Like corpses on a field of war
And they just don't make me cry no more
And the highway's like an old sad song
People moving through their lives alone
On the run from grace
From place to place
Like fugitives without a home
And the highway's like an old sad song
And my heart is black as coal
It's been mined and there ain't no gold
It's so dark in there
But I don't care
I will lay down in the this empty hole
Where my heart is black as coal
And oh, there is nowhere left to go from here
I have fallen past the last frontier
But at the bottom of this well I hear you breathing
Love below me
Love around me
Love above me
Love has found me
Love has found me here
So lay me down
Oh, lay me down in a field of golden
Lay me down
Oh, lay me down in a field of golden
Lay me down
(Love above, love below me)
Oh, lay me down in a field of gold and green"
"1642" "Somewhere along the Scottish coast
And emerald island lies
And I will steer my sailing boat
Unto the Isle of Skye

From heavy cloud to fair
And even when it's raining
It's always lovely there"
"1643" "One two three two.
It's so easy to cash in these chips on my shoulder,
So easy to lose this whole tongue like a tiger.
It's easy to let all this bitterness smolder,
Just to hide it away like a cigarette lighter.
It's easy to curse and to hurt and to hinder.
It's easy to not have the heart to remember
That I am a priest and a prince in the kingdom of God.
I've got voices that scream in my head like a siren,
Fears that I feel in the night when I sleep.
Stupid choices I made when I laid in the mire,
Like a kid in the mud on some dirty, blind street.
I've got sorrow to spare, I've got loneliness too.
I've got blood on these hands that hold on to the truth,
That I am a priest and a prince in the kingdom of God.
Well I swore on the bible to not tell a lie, but I've lied and lied.
And I've crossed my heart and I hoped to die, and I've died and died.
But if it's true that you gathered my sin in your hand and you cast it as far as the east from the west,
If it's true that you put on the flesh of a man, and you walked in my shoes through the shadow of death,
If it's true that you dwell in the halls of my heart, then I'm not just a fool with a fancy guitar.
No, I am a priest and a prince in the kingdom, I am a priest and a prince in the kingdom of God."
"1644" "You could no more kill the darkness
Than you could raise the sun
And the sky was cold and black
Like the barrel of a gun
And I remember the tremble
In the words you spoke
As you balanced there on the brink
At the end of your rope
You came so close to letting go
And you knew she would hate you
She would kick you out
You'd been lying in the bed that you made
When you broke your vow
Then you woke in the wasteland
Of the truth you told
And you turned to see she stayed,
She was bright as a band of gold
You came so close to letting go
So don't let go, 'cause you never know
Don't let go, you never know for sure
And the sky in Nashville
It can bend you low
'Cause the winter here is gray
Without a trace of snow
But there is no shadow
On the silver stars
And the colder the night is,
The closer the heavens are
And we're so close
So don't let go
'Cause this I know
Don't let go
This I know for sure:
There's still hope"
"1645" "Come climb the hill with me
Come and be still with me
Come watch the sun sink away
If you will with me
Come watch the garden grow
Down by the gravel road
Come warm your hands in the gold
Of the afterglow
Into the peace of these wild things,
Into the wild of this grace,
Into the grace of this blessing,
Speak in the peace of this place
Come walk the cedar stand
Over the broken dam
Sit on the bench at the bend in the trail again
Look how the children laugh
Out in the tumble grass
Bright as a fire and as fine as a photograph
CHORUS
Here at the magic hour
Time and eternity
Mingle a moment in chorus
Here at the magic hour
Bright is the mystery
Plain is the beauty before us
Could this beauty be for us?
What is this voice that sings
Holy and hovering
Over this hill in the still of the evening?
(Son of God, speak)"
"1646" "I remember once I broke down in the country
I was sixteen with a broken heart in bloom
And I walked home through the pines
Nobody saw me but the moon
By sunrise I could hear the church bells ringing
I got there as the saints were marching in
I sat down on the back row
And heard the story once again
And the servants of the secret fire
Were gathered there
The embers of the ages
Like a living prayer
And all at once I saw the shadows flee
Shine your light on me, on me
Be a light unto my path
And a lamp unto my feet
They flew us down to Oklahoma City
Yeah, but I could hardly stand there on the stage
So sick I couldn't speak
And the fever wouldn't break
But when I stepped up to the microphone I heard it
It was the voices of the brothers at my side
They were singing out my song
When the song in me had died
Oh, shine your light on me
Somebody come and get me when I'm gone
Two years ago I drove into a darkness
I straightened every curve on Cane Ridge Road
And I could hear the flapping wings
Of every devil I have known
And the inside of my car was like a casket
But then it flooded with a blaze of sacred light
She was calling me back home
And as I pulled into the drive
I knew the servants of the secret fire
Were gathered there
The embers of the ages
Like a living prayer
She was standing on the porch where I could see
Shine your light on me, on me
Be a light unto my path
And a lamp unto my feet"
"1647" "I know you've been afraid
Don't know what to do
You've been lost in the questions
I don't know what to say
I'm sure if I were you
I'd proceed with some caution
But I want you to know
When the joy that you feel
Leaves a terrible ache in your bones
It's the voice of Jesus
Calling you back home
I know you've got a lot
Spinning in your head
All this emptiness fills you
Maybe you could try
Laying in your bed
To ask the silence to still you
And you might hear a beat
On the door of your heart
When you do, let it open up wide
It's the voice of Jesus
Calling you his bride
Once upon a time there was a little boy
Who wandered the forest, abandoned
And he heard in the leaves
And behind every tree
The sound of a secret companion
Following
So listen, little girl,
Somewhere there's a King
Who will love you forever
And nothing in the world
Could ever come between
You, my love, and this Lover
So when I kiss you at night
And I turn out the light
And I tell you you're never alone
It's the voice of Jesus
Calling you
It's the voice of Jesus
Calling you his own"
"1648" "Well, we took a train to Kensington
And listened to the children run
Just beyond the garden gate
Where Peter and Wendy played
There was a sign that said we weren't allowed
To duck inside and join the crowd
Without a son or daughter's hand
To lead us into Neverland
And it hurt so bad
But it's so good to be young
And I don't want to go back
I just want to go on and on and on
Day by day, day by day
And everybody's so surprised
When right before your very eyes
Your baby's in the second grade
You blink and it's her wedding day
And we just can't get used to being here
Where the ticking clock is loud and clear
Children of eternity
On the run from entropy
And it hurts so bad
But it's so good to be young
And I don't want to go back
I just want to go on and on and on
Day by day, day by day
So don't lose heart
Though your body's wasting away
Your soul is not
It's being remade
Day by day by day
Well, you have never met a single soul
Who didn't feel the curse's toll
Who didn't wish that death would die
Maybe that's the reason why
And it hurts so bad
But it's so good to be young
And I don't want to go back
I just want to go on and on and on
So don't lose heart
Though your body's wasting away
Your soul is not
It's being remade
So don't lose heart
Don't lose heart
Your body will rise and never decay
Day by day by day"
"1649" "When I look at you, boy
I can see the road that lies ahead
I can see the love and the sorrow
Bright fields of joy
Dark nights awake in a stormy bed
I want to go with you, but I can't follow
So keep to the old roads
Keep to the old roads
And you'll find your way
Your first kiss, your first crush
The first time you know you're not enough
The first time there's no one there to hold you
The first time you pack it all up
And drive alone across America
Please remember the words that I told you
Keep to the old roads
Keep to the old roads
And you'll find your way
You'll find your way
If love is what you're looking for
The old roads lead to an open door
And you'll find your way
You'll find your way
Back home
And I know you'll be scared when you take up that cross
And I know it'll hurt, 'cause I know what it costs
And I love you so much and it's so hard to watch
But you're gonna grow up and you're gonna get lost
Just go back, go back
Go back, go back to the ancient paths
Lash your heart to the ancient mast
And hold on, boy, whatever you do
To the hope that's taken hold of you
And you'll find your way
You'll find your way
If love is what you're looking for
The old roads lead to an open door
And you'll find your way
You'll find your way
Back home"
"1650" "I remember the day of the Tennessee flood
The sound of the scream and the sight of the blood
My son he saw as the animal died
In the jaws of the dog as the river ran by
I said, \"Come back soon.\"
It's there on the page of the book that I read
The boy grew up and the yearling was dead
He stood at the gate with the angel on guard
And wept for the death of his little boy heart
I say, \"Come back soon.\"
We wake in the night in the womb of the world
We beat our fists on the door
We cannot breathe in this sea that swirls
So we groan in this great darkness
For deliverance
Deliverance, O Lord
I sit on the bench at the bend in the trail
And I can feel in the fall the final exhale
The trees of the field all wring their hands
And the leaves go by like a funeral band
I say, \"Come back soon.\"
We wake in the night in the womb of the world
We beat our fists on the door
We cannot breathe in this sea that swirls
So we groan in this great darkness
Are we alone in this great darkness?
If nature's red in tooth and in claw
Then it seems to me that she's an outlaw
'Cause every death is a question mark
At the end of the book of a beating heart
And the answer is scrawled in the silent dark
On the dome of the sky in a billion stars
But we cannot read these angel tongues
And we cannot stare at the burning sun
And we cannot sing with these broken lungs
So we kick in the womb and we beg to be born
Deliverance!
Deliverance, O Lord!"
"1651" "You are not alone
I will always be with you
Even to the end
You don't have to work so hard
You can rest easy
You don't have to prove yourself
You're already mine
You don't have to hide your heart
I already love you
I hold it in mine
So you can rest easy
Do not be afraid
Nothing, nothing in the world
Can come between us now
You don't have to work so hard
You can rest easy
You don't have to prove yourself
You're already mine
You don't have to hide your heart
I already love you
I hold it in mine
So you can rest easy
You work so hard to wear yourself down
And you're running like a rodeo clown
You're smiling like you're scared to death
You're out of faith and all out of breath
You're so afraid you've got nowhere left to go
Well, you are not alone
I will always be with you
You don't have to work so hard
You can rest easy
You don't have to prove yourself
You're already mine
You don't have to hide your heart
I already love you
I hold it in mine
You can rest easy"
"1652" "I will hold your hand, love
As long as I can, love
Though the powers rise against us
Though your fears assail you
And your body may fail you
There's a fire that burns within us
And we dream in the night
Of a city descending
With the sun in the center
And a peace unending
I will carry the fire for you
And we kneel in the water
The sons and the daughters
And we hold our hearts before us
And we look to the distance
And raise our resistance
In the face of the forces
Gathered against us
And we dream in the night
Of a king and a kingdom
Where joy writes the songs
And the innocent sing them
I will carry the fire for you
Oh, sing on, sing on
When your hope is gone
Sing on, sing on (Light up the darkness)
And we dream in the night
Of a feast and a wedding
And the groom in his glory
When the bride is made ready
I will carry the fire for you"
"1653" "Can't you feel it in your bones
Something isn't right here
Something that you've always known
But you don't know why
'Cause every time the sun goes down
We face another night here
Waiting for the world to spin around
Just to survive
But when you see the morning sun
Burning through a silver mist
Don't you want to thank someone?
Don't you want to thank someone for this?
Don't you ever wonder why
In spite of all that's wrong here
There's still so much that goes so right
And beauty abounds?
'Cause sometimes when you walk outside
The air is full of song here
The thunder rolls and the baby sighs
And the rain comes down
And when you see the spring has come
And it warms you like a mother's kiss
Don't you want to thank someone?
Don't you want to thank someone for this?
I used to be a little boy
As golden as a sunrise
Breaking over Illinois
When the corn was tall
Yeah, but every little boy grows up
And he's haunted by the heart that died
Longing for the world that was
Before the Fall
Oh, but then forgiveness comes
A grace that I cannot resist
And I just want to thank someone
I just want to thank someone for this
Now I can see the world is charged
It's glimmering with promises
Written in a script of stars
Dripping from prophets' lips
But still, my thirst is never slaked
I am hounded by a restlessness
Eaten by this endless ache
But still I will give thanks for this
'Cause I can see it in the seas of wheat
I can feel it when the horses run
It's howling in the snowy peaks
It's blazing in the midnight sun
Just behind a veil of wind
A million angels waiting in the wings
A swirling storm of cherubim
Making ready for the Reckoning
Oh, how long, how long?
Oh, sing on, sing on
And when the world is new again
And the children of the King
Are ancient in their youth again
Maybe it's a better thing
A better thing
To be more than merely innocent
But to be broken then redeemed by love
Maybe this old world is bent
But it's waking up
And I'm waking up
'Cause I can hear the voice of one
He's crying in the wilderness
\"Make ready for the Kingdom Come\"
Don't you want to thank someone for this?
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Come back soon
Come back soon"
"1654" "I saw the desert wind
Tear across the wilderness
I felt it blowing off the page
The teacher told me, \"Son,
Always remember this\"
And I have always been afraid
I read about the God of Moses
Roaring in the holy cloud
It shook my bedroom window panes
I did not understand then
I do not understand now
I don't expect you to explain
You've been a mystery since the moment that I met you
You never move but I can never seem to catch you
The Cornerstone
You said to eat your flesh
Before you broke the bread and blessed it
Before you poured the wine for every man
This is a hard, hard teaching
Can any man accept it?
Can any sage here understand?
You turned the tables over
There in your father's temple
You cracked a whip and raised a shout
My daughter asked me why
I said, \"Love is never simple
It draws 'em in and drives 'em out.\"
I saw you there but it was too late to change my course
And I collided with a beautiful immovable force
And so the stone that I rejected
It has become the Cornerstone
All the maps were drawn
But the maps were wrong
The stars spin around
Another sun
All the maps were drawn
But the maps were wrong
The rivers are running from
The Cornerstone
And you looked me in the eye and fixed me with a permanent stare
I met your gaze and saw the forges of the firmament there
The Cornerstone
And the floods come up
And the rains come down"
"1655" "Do you remember, Jody Baxter
When the whippoorwill sings
How you stole across the pasture
To the little hidden spring?
Where you laid down by the water
On a bed of Spanish moss
And dreamed
When wind was on the prairie
And the fire was in the stove
With the wood you had to carry
From the corner of the grove
And your daddy let you disappear
With all your fishing gear
Into the cove
And it was good, good, good
But now it's gone, gone, gone
And there's a little boy
Who's lost out in the woods
Always looking for the fawn
I remember, Jody Baxter
When I hid out in the corn
How the clouds were moving faster
With the coming of the storm
And I knew that I had broken
Something I could not repair
And I mourned
Because the field was green as Eden
Then it withered into brown
In the middle of my grieving
They came and cut it down
And I was sure that it was all my fault
The day they mowed the garden
To the ground
What was good, good, good
Is gone, gone, gone
And there's a little boy
Who's lost out in the woods
Always looking for the fawn
So come back to me
Please, come back to me
Is there any way that we can
Change the ending of this tragedy?
Or does it have to be this way?
I can see you, Jody Baxter
Now you're broken by the years
As you lie down in the aster
And listen for the deer
And I'm a million miles away
But I still pray the fawn can find me
Here"
"1656" "Do you remember how we used to drive
Over the mountain and down to the river bend
Where the ghosts of the valley all haunt the tracks
The highway calls your stories back again
Oh, Jamie, I'm all alone out here, and all I used to know is in the wind
And now, I don't recognize a thing
I need a brand new song to sing
So tell me the story I still need to hear
Tell me we're gonna make it out alive again
I need to know there's nothing left to fear, there's nothing left to hide
So will you look me in the eye, and say we will survive
Someday the truth's gonna lay us bare
We're gonna raise a glass to the past and say
It's only when the straight line breaks and heals a little crooked
That you ever see the grace
Well I had to find a better place; maybe the bend in the river's the only way
And I'm lost -- got all these voices in my head
I need some hope up there instead
So tell me the story I still need to hear
Tell me about the sun that's gonna rise again
I need to know there's nothing left to fear, there's nothing left to hide
So will you look me in the eye, and say we will survive
We will survive
Do you remember how I used to say
Love is a fire and it's gonna burn us up
To make the space for grace to grow
Well, now it feels like love has called my bluff
So tell me the story I still need to hear
Tell me about the love that never dies
Tell me the story I still need to hear
Tell me we're gonna make it out alive again
I need to know there's nothing left to fear
There's nothing left to hide
So when you look me in the eye, I know we will survive
We will survive
I know we will survive
I know we will survive"

You would rather be anyone else
I love you just the way that you are
I love the way He made your precious heart
Be kind to yourself Be kind to yourself
I know it's hard to hear it when that anger in your spirit
Is pointed like an arrow at your chest
When the voices in your mind are anything but kind
And you can't believe your
Father knows best
I love you just the way that you are
I love the way He's shaping your heart
Be kind to yourself
Be kind to yourself
How does it end when the war that you're in
Is just you against you against you
Gotta learn to love, learn to love
Learn to love your enemies too
You can't expect to be perfect
It's a fight you've gotta forfeit
You belong to me whatever you do
So lay down your weapon, darling
Take a deep breath and believe that I love you

The flowers climb through the snow
The willows weep and the clover bloom

That's stronger than the noise
Rejoice
Rejoice
And when the peace turns to danger
The nights are longer than days
And every friend has a stranger's face
Then deep within the dungeon cell
You have to make a choice
Rejoice
Rejoice
Rejoice
And again I say
And again I say
And again I say
And again I say
Rejoice
Be still and know that the Father
Will hasten down from His throne
He will rejoice over you with song

And now my heart is like a catacomb
And I'm praying we can find a way to raise these bones
Again, oh, again
Well, I want to say I'm sorry but it's not enough
To close the wounds I opened up
So now I've got this sorrow and you've got that hurt
And we can't go back to who we were
Oh, but could that mean I'm someone new
Maybe I can love you better than I failed to do
Before the war
They'll tell you everything was beautiful and pure
But there was poison in the well from years before
And now I'm cleaning up this wreckage on the shore
And I don't want to fight with you no more
So I want to say I'm sorry that I drew the line
I built the wall, the fault is mine
And maybe now the only way to find some peace
Is just to give it time and trust in grace
So this is my communion hymn
I want to sit beside you at the feast, my friend
Again, again and again
And again"
"1664" "Oh God, I am furrowed like the field
Torn open like the dirt
And I know that to be healed
That I must be broken first
I am aching for the yield
That You will harvest from this hurt

Let these branches bear You fruit
Abide in me, Lord
As I abide in You
So I kneel
At the bright edge of the garden
At the golden edge of dawn
At the glowing edge of spring
When the winter's edge is gone
And I can see the color green
I can hear the sower's song
Abide in me
Let these branches bear You fruit
Abide in me, Lord
Let Your word take root
Remove in me
The branch that bears no fruit
And move in me, Lord
As I abide in You
As the rain and the snow fall
Down from the sky
And they don't return but they water the earth and bring they forth life
Giving seed to the sower, bread for the hunger
So shall the word of the Lord be with a sound like thunder
And it will not return, it will not return void
We shall be led in peace
And go out with joy
And the hills before us
Will raise their voices
And the trees of the field will clap their hands as the land rejoices
And instead of the thorn now
The cypress towers
And instead of the briar the myrtle blooms with a thousand flowers
And it will make a name
Make a name for our God
A sign everlasting that will never be cut off
As the earth brings forth sprouts from the seed
What is sown in the garden grows into a mighty tree
So the Lord plants justice, justice and praise
To rise before the nations till the end of days
As the rain and the snow fall
Down from the sky
And they don't return but they water the earth and they bring forth life
Giving seed to the sower, and bread for the hunger
So shall the word of the Lord be with a sound like thunder
And it will not return, it will not return void
It will not return, it will not return void
It will not return, it will not return void
We shall be led in peace
And go out with joy

I used to sit there when I was a child
Ivy and moss, little daisies
Covered the lane long ago
So many years have passed
The dew is still on the roses
I kept my memories
In that garden green
I kept my memories
In that garden green"

"1702" "Golden skin and brown hair
Spiller is coming home
Spiller is coming home
As sly as a little fox
He knows every tree and track
And the secrets of the wind
With a bow and a quiver
Spiller is hunting alone
From dawn till day is done
He will guide you through the night
'Cause he knows every hidden trail
From the river to the woods
Golden skin and brown hair
Spiller is coming home
Spiller is coming home
What a strange and tasty meal
Cricket's legs and strawberries"

Far from the land you'll be leaving

And rich in its treasures golden
But you'll pine I know for long, long ago
And the love that is never olden
A stÃ³r mo chroÃ­ when the evening's mist
Over mountain and sea is falling
Won't you turn a stÃ³r to erin's shore
And the ones that you're leaving behind you
For the sound of a voice that is surely miss
For somebody's quick returning
A ruin, a ruin, oh won't you come back soon
To the one who will always love you
A stÃ³r mo chroÃ­ when you're far away
Far from the land you'll be leaving
For the stranger's land may be bright and fair

"1707" "I am a young maiden, my story is sad
For once I was carefree and in love with a lad
He courted me sweetly, by night and by day
But now he has left me and gone far away
Oh if I was a blackbird, could whistle and sing
I'd follow the vessel my true love sails in
And in the top rigging I would there build my nest
And I'd flutter my wings to his broad golden chest
He sailed o'er the ocean, his fortune to seek
I missed his caresses and his kiss on my cheek
Oh if I was a blackbird, could whistle and sing
I'd follow the vessel my true love sails in
And in the top rigging I would there build my nest
And I'd flutter my wings to his broad golden chest
Then he offered to marry and to stay by my side
But then in the morning he sailed with the tide
I am a young maiden, my story is sad
Oh if I was a blackbird, could whistle and sing
I'd follow the vessel my true love sails in
And in the top rigging I would there build my nest
And I'd flutter my wings to his broad golden chest"

Ivory foam and gloomy rain

Longed to see her face

I remember the day your eyes fell on me

Why are you sad?
You knew I had to leave
'Cause I live in a different world
Still I'm not so far away from you
I feel so small down in the garden
My mind is restless when I think of you
We're so alike and so different

Please save a place in your heart for me"

Feel my hair blowing in the wind
See the sky in the summer rain
Pick a flower from the garden for you
Beyond the lane there's another world
Butterflies floating in the air
Is there someone out there for me?
And so life goes on day after day
With knick-knacks on the floor, nooks and crannies
I live in a tiny world
But out there someone waits for me
I wish I had someone to watch over me
In my dreams oh I wish I could
Feel my hair blowing in the wind

You will be in my mind forever
Though I know it's time for farewell
Here we stand with trembling hearts
Here we stand with sparkles in our eyes
I must be dreaming
Is this a magic time?
Is this a fairytale?
Or are you an angel
Are you sent from heaven
Just for me?
Don't you know that
The stars will fall and the storms will come
You will be in my mind forever
Though we know it's time for farewell
Here we stand with trembling hearts
Here we stand with sparkles in our eyes"

It was built for little people and maybe one day
They will come into the doll's house, live there forever
They will, they will, they will
In this pretty little house the kitchen is my favourite place
Tiny plates, little forks, it looks so real
Cooking pots and baking pans, it's such a perfect place
Would you like a cup of tea or a piece of cake?
Take care of the doll's house, my father used to say
It was built for little people and maybe one day

Where my heart has gently grown.
And where the trees are in bloom forever.
I could spend my whole life with you.
Under a shady grove just waiting for the stars.
We would have a shelter at the top of the highest tree.
We would look at the sky before we sleep.
Promise me, we will live underneath the stars.
The nightengale will sing, \"La la la la la\".
It's a sweet song.
Underneath the stars,
We would be lovers from the hill.
By the hazy mountains my love's sweetly grown
And where the secrets are kept forever.
I could spend a lifetime with you
under a white maple tree staring at the skies.
We would have a shelter at the top of the highest tree.
We would look at the sky before we sleep.
Promise me, we will live underneath the stars.
The nightengale will sing, \"La la la la la\".
It's a sweet song.
Underneath the stars,
We would be lovers from the hill.
Promise me, we will live underneath the stars.

"1718" "I knew something was wrong
That morning when I logged on to Facebook
Something about my profile seemed asked
I did my status updated, checked them newsfeed items
And then it hit me
Yesterday I had forty-three friends, but today forty-two
Defriended
I miss your little face
It hurts to be deleted
Am I that easy to erase?
Defriended
I send you virtual sushit
I superpoked you endlessly
And now you set me free
Why did I raise my hopes?
I must have read three hundred of your posts
You always looked so happy in them photo-tags I see
Did you put your trust in that Google Plus?
Are you twiddling off a Tweet?
Is Friendster more of a friend to you than me?
Defriended
I miss your half-inch face
It hurts to be deleted
Am I that easy to erase?
Defriended
I send you virtual sushit
I superpoked you endlessly
And now you set me free
I could have had a Mafia War with you
We could have grown a Farmville or two
It's not me, it's not you, but after all we've been through
I'd even let you pet me in your petting zoo
Will you log on?
Will you log on?

Bitter taste still in my mouth
Too much whiskey, too much smoke
Last night's tears hang on my coat
But now the rain has stopped its fall
Streets shine like a mirror ball
Sun comes on, it's just enough
Watch the flower's waking up
It's washing day, it's washing day
Colors run and they fade away
It's washing day, it's washing day
Feel the threads like new again
Big machines all in a row
Mother with her child in tow
Change old paper for silver coins
Lose myself in all this noise
Wake up from a peaceful rest
Counting down, one minute left
Cotton stops its jog in place
I hold it warm against my face
It's washing day, it's washing day
Colors run and they fade away
It's washing day, it's washing day
Feel the threads like new again
What's this in my dungarees
In my back pocket, curled and creased
My old notebook, filled with you
Our secrets now just streaks of blue
It's all a mess but beautiful
This emptiness, a gift I hold
I write a poem with you in mind
And leave the memories behind
I leave the memories behind
It's washing day, it's washing day
Colors run and they fade away
It's washing day, it's washing day
Feel the threads like new again
Feel the threads like new again
Feel the threads like new again"
"1720" "I like missing you in the mornings
when the air's too cold to feel nice.
And I like hearing your sneakers stomping
down the stairs when you stomp out of sight,
and I like how all your walls surround you,
so that I can't ever come inside
and I like holding you and then falling down.
I like feeling your arms around me
and then sneaking out in the morning light
and I like going away sometimes
for a lonely day and a lonely night
and I like singing my nonsense loudly
and then whispering the things I hide
and I like holding you and then falling down.
Oh and I like you when you're out of view
'cause I have this perfect picture in my mind
And I like you and it feels so true
'cause I have this perfect picture, yeah
and it's become a fixture,
this pretty, pretty picture of you in my mind.
I like trying to read your scribbles
because they keep me guessing everytime.
And I like wondering if you want me
and then you tell me this feels just right.
And I like waking up in the mornings
as our shadows get flushed by the light
and I like holding you and then falling down.
I'm falling down.
I'm falling down.
I'm falling down."
"1721" "You always loved the colors and the details, so here's mine: I snuck out down a dark 17th Street late last night. I took my little orange book lamp and the notebook with the stars on the front, the sleeping bag that my ex gave to me to keep me warm, and a black fountain pen to write the words that it was too late to say out loud.
And my eyes turned green, like they do when I'm crying, and my heart it went to blue 'cause you told me that I might not be what you need, you want to try more out, but you're the only thing I can't stop thinking about.
Yeah, I like you a lot.. and I think it's worse than that.
You said you love it when all the words in a song move really fast and your ears have to choose just one little phrase to hold on to. And you love it when all the chords are really simple so you can play it on the guitar, and then when it goes to a funny one at the end you like that too (insert funny chord here). And so I'll build you a song, and I know you're gonna love it 'cause I'm putting in all the pieces that you said you wanted in it and I'm writing it here in my room in just my underwear and an orange t-shirt 'cause I know that you'd think that was hot.
Yeah hot, like that day that you called sick for work because we'd stayed out too late at The Cheesecake Factory the night before and we held hands on the beach, and I found that crab in a funny shell, and you took video of me holding it up by the newly painted blue motel. And you said \"I like you a lot\" and I thought 'well, this couldn't get much better.'
You said you were so happy you met me when you did 'cause you were starting to think you didn't like people. And you told me that when I moved that I could still stay in your room for weeks. But now I'm wondering if I imagined it or if it was ever really there 'cause they say even in magic nothing truly disappears, it just gets stuffed up somebody's sleeve or behind their hand or on top of their head.. and you forgot to keep your eye on it, you were looking down instead.
So now I'm the fool up on stage at the magic show searching the deck for my card while everyone laughs because they know that it's in plain sight to see, yeah it's stuck on your forehead, but I can't think you're mean 'cause I volunteered to be misled.
Yeah 'cause I like you a lot.. but I don't know what to do with it now.
And I like you a lot.. but I didn't think it'd hurt this bad.
And I like you a lot.. and we both know that it's worse than that."
"1722" "Too young to understand why she went away
Too old to admit that I wouldn't be okay
So I hardened my heart that day
I wiped the feelings off my face
She said it was her and it wasn't my fault
It wasn't my fault
But when somebody leaves
Just like they all do
It's easy to think
That it might be you
When somebody leaves
Like they all do
It ain't easy
His eyes told me we were through and he'd be okay
I just looked down as my true love walked away
And it hardened my heart that day
But I wiped the feelings off my face
He said it was him
And it wasn't my fault
Was it my fault
'Cause when somebody leaves
Like they all do
It's easy to think
That it might be you
When somebody leaves
Like they all do
It ain't easy
But I will stay strong and I will stay busy and
I won't lean too much to your side
And in July we'll call it freedom
And one day this sheen that covers my eyes
Will melt away
It'll fall drip down by the wayside
I just need time
This town was feeling so small and I needed space
So I packed my things in my blue suitcase and I drove away
But it hardened my heart that day
When he wiped his feelings off his face
Cause he thought it was him
But it wasn't his fault
No it was just me
But when somebody leaves
Like we all do
It's easy to think
That it might be you
When somebody leaves

It ain't easy
It ain't easy
It ain't easy"
"1723" "Suddenly you?re shaken with pain
Shooting down inside you
And now you?re crumbling away
But this isn?t like you
It doesn?t stop ?til it breaks down all you know
Your breathing locks and your balance goes
Ladadadadadadada
It takes a minute
Ladadadadadadada
It doesn?t finish
Ladadadadadadada
You?re breaking faster
Ladadadadada
You?re nothing after
There?s nothing after
You try to make your escape
But the blows keep on coming
And as the dust clears away
You start to notice something
Each time a piece crashes down into the floor
You?re a little lighter than just before
Ladadadadadadada
It takes a minute
Ladadadadadadada
It doesn?t finish
Ladadadadadadada
You?ll see it after
Ladadadadada
When you look backwards
When you look backwards"
"1724" "Bouncy ball lovers
Exploding in colors as they
Lean down over the pier
Move like the tide
On an October night
And they laugh
Till they run out of air
The moon sets
Beneath the ocean line
Watch it go down down
As their emotions
Start to rise
Far away sound
Of the waves
Unchosen their strides
Slowly they open,
Like arms
That were folded
Like eyes
That woke up in the sun
Cautious to feel,
And anxious to heal
This loneliness
That had begun
She fell in the bed
In his arms
They tumbled around
Their heads lost
Beneath eachothers hearts
The walls were surrounded
In unfinished art
They fit together
Like love on a letter
Like tulips
On a table for two
And on that same day
As she left for Santa Fe
He said,
\"I'm rather crazy for you\"
And he brushed down
His hair to one side
And he went through the rounds
Of his knuckles popping
From the left to the right
He took out his canvas
And painted blue-green lines
Oo oo oo"
"1725" "Had my canvas primed in white, some water by my bed, a wooden palette smeared with reds and gray s and blues. Dipped my brush into the paint, traced the outline of your face, then I washed it clean for color number two. There's a little drop of paint in a mason jar of water that turned every last ounce a crimson hue. And it's the same with you, you had a minute with my heart, now you color everything that I do. Stew pot's on the boil, house was filled with steam, bowls and spoons in twos like Noah's ark. Dash of salt and spice to make it like you like, bring it to my lips and there you are. There's a little pinch of salt in a ladle full of comfort that opens all the flavors into bloom. And it's the same with you, you had a minute with my heart and now you color everything that I do. A flower turns its face to the sun. Snow melting makes the river run. Tide rises high to meet the moon, meet the moon. There's an echo in my ear sounding like your voice, a feeling that fills any empty room. You had a minute with my heart and I live it every day 'cause when you brushed against my heart it soaked through. And now my whole world is tinted with you. Yeah, you color everything that I do."
"1726" "In the Creases
Youre the smell of the toast that you made in the mornings.
Youre the page in my book that I keep to myself.
Youre the unlocking sound when I turn my door key.
Youre the scar that I have from the time that I fell.
I cant describe the faces.
I cant recall the names.
But you remain..
I keep you in the creases.
I hide you in the folds.
Protect you from the sunlight.
Shield you from the cold.
Everybody said they were glad to see you go.
But no one ever has to know.
Youre the part of the moon that blends into the blackness.
Even though we know its really still there.
Youre the song that I sing and I dont need to practice.
Youre the green shirt I keep though its too small to wear.
I cant describe the faces.
I cant recall the names.
But you remain..
I keep you in the creases.
I hide you in the folds.
Protect you from the sunlight.
Shield you from the cold.
Everybody said they were glad to see you go.
But no one ever has to
No one ever has to know the things that I refuse to see
And all the nights I still cant sleep.
I curl up in the sheets
Between the creases where you used to be.
Once love wakes it never sleeps
Even when you love a dream."
"1727" "I found a little pot, took it in the kitchen
And filled it with some dirt, planted a chrysanthemum
And you should've seen how it turned my mood to yellow
It turned my mood to yellow in a day
I read about a boy who suffered depression
His parents hung a mirror inside his bedroom
And they made him smile at it three times a day
'Til it took his depression away
And it goes to show that there's a natural way
Of healing what we're feeling inside
It goes to show that before we prescribe
We should first try a simple smile
So I drive out to the middle of nowhere
And I turn little as I stare up at the stars in the sky
And these heavens erase any worries I face
If I look up once in a while
And it goes to show that there's a natural way
Of healing what we're feeling inside
It goes to show that before we prescribe
We should first try a simple smile
Give it a
Smile, smile, smile
Just a little
Smile, smile, smile"
"1728" "He recognized the fracture line and asked
How bad's the pain
I said it's feeling worse than ever, can't you make it go away
He studied my heart up and down and said
I've never seen one quite this bad
I'll wrap it up if you want me to but I
Must be warning you
A split won't work, a cast won't last
A band-aid will come unglued
The only way to heal your heart
Is keeping loving til one loves you
Ooh the doctor said it's true
Ooh now get better soon
Well I knew that I couldn't wait and he'd walked out the door
So I grabbed the Novacaine and some pills from his drawer
And when I got home I held my heart and
Bandaged all those ugly scars
Numbed the pain and popped the pills until my heart went still
And life just passed by every day like every day before
I felt no love, I felt no pain
I played my part and nothing more
Ooh the doctor said it's true
Oooh now get better soon
I couldn't stand the pain
I couldn't stand the pain
I couldn't stand the pain so I washed it away
I couldn't stand the pain
I ran into the doc last weekend at the grocery superstore
He asked me how's it feeling and I said it's barely sore
But he saw my eyes so dark and blank and that
Practiced smile on my face
He said there's one more thing to do and I think it might cure you
Write down everything you loved about the one you knew
Then love yourself in that same way and in no time you'll be brand new
Ooh the doctor said it's true
Oooh now get better soon
Ooh get better soon
Ooh get better soon
The doctor said today it can all go away
Now get better soon"

And now I am watching you follow her out the door
Of my house, and it feels so mean
I didnt know youd moved on to another heart
While I was picking mine up with its broken parts
I did it to him, you did it to me
Shell do it to you cause were 23 years old
And thats what we do when were 23
And I still remember watching you in November
Like a Hollywood movie on the silver screen
And you looked so good in 2-D
That I fell blindly for you like hed fallen for me
And I recognized the same look in your eye yesterday
As you watched her through your camera with the split-second delay
I did it to him, you did it to me
Youre next on the list cause shes 23 years old
And thats what we do when were 23
And I wouldnt take it back cause now I know more about me
But I shouldve had a laugh earlier cause its pretty silly
How we slide along the winning edge and the losing edge and the middle
And we dance around and poke ourselves on this love triangle
I did it to him, you did it to me
Shes doing it to you, we should start dating people that are 30 at least
Cause thats what we do when were 23 years old
And thats only half of the stupid stuff we do when were 23 years old
And thats what we do when were 23"

How in the world do we ever repay
So many angels
Such a long road but weve made it to here
A step at a time in an ocean of tears
Hoping there wont be a day thats so hard to get through

Love can be- I know that somebody somewhere is waiting for me.
If I could have any wish on a star
In a world where that dreams do come true

with my hand in my pocket
pants made of thread
Sun beat down on my back, I was drowsy
wearing nothing for shoes and a bun on my head
you went by in a 90s ferrari
sipping' bottle of sky
draped with hearts on your chest
and you revved, i was struck by your lightning
hair was spinning i barely could breath
I turned to play-do in an instant
couldn't stray my eyes from your direction
you know, you know, you know
(Chorus)
Know, I got a picture
riddin' in the summer
with your hair flightin' fire
like the top of a rose
you blew me a kiss
with your hands raised through the ceiling
got those bustling lips
miss america
ooo
And simply put,
I was lost in obsession
I'd just seen venus, the goddess for me
next thing I know
you're off in the distance, same old story
a dream that is not meant to be
I would have chased you through the desert
wouldn't stop for water from a fountain
my face, so great for you
(Chorus)
I need a sun
then I'm headed for grace
on the right road headed for the right place
now I can see
that it's great - ow

shake off the ancient dust of your heartless fathers
and rain pounds upon Tyne upon Tweed upon the daylight
darlings, sweating to keep you upright
how I love to leave you crooning your songs
mooning away the time to stretch farther
while he chased the lovely tails of youth turned soft and holy
makes loose the leashes and lashes of this cracked armor
all skin and bones and no home
born alone only to end me alone
all skin and bones and no home
your words digest space cruising red hot swollen lines
tight nights awake pushing forth
bring me blue, answering lashes and eyes we grow long
hard limbs protecting our colors from each other burned hollow"

"1760" "Oh, Johnny was a tall man but his memory was short
He'd forget to duck at doorways and often he'd get hurt
I took good care of him for he had no family
Actually he did, but he forgot who they be
Johnny often liked to go out on the town
He'd forget where he'd be going so he'd just wander around
I knew when he was back for I would hear the smack
Of his head hitting the doorway but tonight it was alack
Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace
But wherever it's a-lying there's a smile upon his face
I should have seen it coming, he finally lost his mind
But if his head don't turn up soon then all his hats are mine
Johnny came towards me but suddenly he stopped
As if trying to think of something but having no luck
Still he didn't notice that his head weren't there
'Til he took out a brush and tried to comb his hair
I said, \"Johnny where's your cranium?\" but he didn't seem to know
He just shrugged his shoulders and tried to find his nose
And the sight of him there topless made me start to cry
For I feared we'd ne'er again see eye to eye
Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace
But wherever it's a-lying there's a smile upon his face
I should have seen it coming, he should have stayed in bed
For now I fear he'll spend his life just trying to get ahead
Refusing to believe that he had split for good
His lower half and me searched the neighbourhood
It soon became apparent that his head we wouldn't find it
He could not retrace his steps, he was absent minded
Well years went by til late one night I heard a voice I swore
Was Johnny calling out to me, I flung open the door
Johnny's head was home, it took a taxi cab
Alas, it was too late, his body had gone bad
Johnny's head was homeless, his body was cremated
And the funeral was harder than he had anticipated
I should of seen it coming he said in his eulogy
But never thought I'd have to say I ain't got no-body
(I ain't got nobody)
Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace

But now his head's upon a shelf, a smile upon his face"
"1761" "And here's a letter from Bill Macy of Gainesville, Florida
It appears to me that Gainsville Sun is withholding information from the public.
Recently, there was a four-column spread about a probable murder from a gun.
Another item tells of a shooting death in Key Biscaine
A third item tells us of a soldier shooting his wife and children.
I can count on such reports in about every issue of the Sun.
We can be sure of many more incidents have occured of people being PROTECTED from injury or death, because they had a gun.
These reports can be easily obtained from the National Rifle Association.
I am sure they keep accurate records of such protection.
The failure to report these cases of protection is not fair.
I urge you to correct this.
I suggest a small box in every paper called \"Protected By Guns.\"
Simply insert the number of such protections.
On those rare days when none are noted, simply put a zero in the box.
Thanks, Bill."
"1762" "Through the ages, through war, pestilence and sleet, the Celtic culture has survived, it's songs and dances passed from father to son, from mother to daughter, from uncle to goat. And though few still speak Gaelic, the ancient language of the Celts, all hearts are still stirred by the beautiful tones of this mellifluous tongue.
Ah ma wee hach patew mae bo clee hach maneagh
Heow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow BARK meow
Saigh hough loo loo cheow dach hagh vreigh chouach mouheaugh
Douauh meah mae couchah moo ma meagh pach hooragh
And though other cultures tried to destroy them, driven no doubt by their jealousy of the Celts' fine fashion sense and edible cuisine, they did not surrender. Actually, they surrendered quite often, but they were never entirely wiped out, clinging to the corners of small islands, their voices raised in song, the clarion call of the pipes ringing out to the heavens.

"1763" "I bought a ticket to Austrailia, for my holidays,
Got my boarding pass, found out at last,
That I was seated in the middle of the row.
The buisness man beside me smelled like Old Spice, and Gin.
The lady to my left was talkin bout her grandchildren.
Two kids behind me were screamin for their mum.
She was screamin back,
\"Wonder how come?\"
I got the worst seat on the plane,
By the time I land I'll be insane.
My legs are startin to go numb, and,
I just wanna kill someone.
I got the worst seat on the plane,
Bladders full, my back's a pain,
Next time I have somewhere to go,
Think I'll ride my bicycle.
I can't go to sleep, 'cause the pillow's too damn awkward,
So I try to watch the movie, but it starred Kevin Costner.
Earphones hurt my head, and the reading lamp was dead,
Then the pilot said \"Turbulence is on the way.\"
My food try was now on my lap,
The old lady beside me had a heart attack,
Children screamed so loud I thought my skull would crack,
Buisness man turned blue, blew up on my back!
I got the worst seat on the plane,
Time I land I'll be insane,
My legs are startin to go numb, and,
I just wanna kill someone!
I got the worst seat on the plane,
Bladders full, my back's a pain
Next time I have somewhere to go,
Think I'll just rent the video!
After seven hours I can take no more.
So I try to open the Emergency door,
But the flight attendant, tackled me to the floor,
She said \"Go back to your seat dear.\"
I said \"I'd rather get off here.\"
I got the worst seat on the plane,
I think I am now insane,
My legs are both completely numb, and,
I want to kill everyone!
I got the worst seat on the plane,
Bladder's full, my back's a pain.
The next time I get Wonderlust,
I think that I'll just take the bus.

I can't drive it home because the muffler it be saggin'
Got a car full of pain
Satan's is my engine, Beelzebub's in my trunk
Mephistopheles' at the wheel because I'm too gosh darn drunk
Baal's my passenger and Lucifer's beside him

I think the seats are broken (Oh, no)
Okay play us some blues on that harp
Blind Lemon Trevor!
[Insert Trevor's cool harmonica solo here]
Please, please mister, take your blessed wrench
Cast out this demon horde and replace the brimstone stench
With the smell of gasoline, a heavenly muffled roar
I'll worship you oh Speedy man, Mister Goodwrench even more
Let it run, let it run, let it run, oh God, let it run
And now it purrs just like a kitten, it roars just like a lion (Roar!? What?)
I purrs just like a temple golden carved by the Mayans
Here comes the mechanic, oh no, how much?
Four hundred bucks, you piece of slime, you smell and you suck
Your father was a jackal, your mom's his sister's bitch

I only have three thoughts and they are: eat, swim, ...eat.

I was swimming in the ocean,

At least until the owners think they need a killer whale.

I'm a shark, I'm a shark,
But I'm not in my natural habitat,
He's fat and old and lazy,
But I'm happy you're here.
I really hope these activists don't free Billy,
'cause out there in the wild, I'd be dead.
The sight of bloodworms put him in a feeding frenzy,
Now it means that it's time to clean the pool.

"1771" "Special guest vocalist, Mike's dad: Bob McCormick
(Mike's dad appears courtesy of Mike's mom)
There once was a time when the country was wide. A time before cars and planes and minivans. So, to move things from one place to the other, the railroad was built. But it just didn't up and build itself. Nope, it was built by the railroad men. And among these men was a man among men among men among men among men among men, a man as tall as the sky and as wide as the land. A man who could lay track faster than anyone else could run. A man with the strength of ten men. His name was John Henry, and I'm not gonna sing about him. No, I'm gonna sing about a lesser know figure, one who doesn't deserve a song. A man as lazy as a thousand men. A man who could barely raise his own body off the ground. A man who was barely a man at all. His name was Mike McCormick.
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man
Who never really gave a damn
Only thing he worked on was his tan
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man
He'd get up in the morning to hammer in them spikes
Unless he'd been up drinking the previous night
Or if his bones weren't feeling right
Or if it looked like it was going to rain
He had a tendency of being late for work
And everyone around thought he was a jerk
He'd take long breaks and say his back was hurt
Then he'd have a drink to ease the pain
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man
Who never really gave a damn
Only thing he worked on was his tan
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man
Mike's dad: Mike! Mike! Get up, Mike!
Mike: What, what is it?
Mike's dad: Get up, it's time to go to work.
Mike: Awww, already?
Mike's dad: Well, don't you want to hammer in them spikes?
Mike: No.
Mike's dad: Oh.
His arms were like twigs and his legs were like straws
His hands were like a baby's bum they were so soft
He'd wheeze and moan and whine and cough
Then go home and take a little nap
He never got fired 'cause he was the boss' son
He just hung around and bothered everyone
Never drove a spike, not a single one
Though now and then he'd give a tap
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man
Who never really gave a damn
Only thing he worked on was his tan
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man
Mike's dad: Mike! Mike! MIKE!
Mike: What? What is it?
Mike's dad: They say they got a big machine that they say can drive in nails faster than any man alive.
Mike: Sounds like a good idea.
Mike's dad: No! No! No!
Mike: Yeah, it'll work faster.
Mike's dad: You don't understand! You see, it's gonna cost us all our jobs. You, Mike McCormick, gotta prove 'em wrong!
Mike: Okay.
So he took his hammer and hammered one time (Ow!)
He took his hammer and hammered two times (Oh, jeez!)
He took his hammer and hammered three times (Ohhh!)
Then he got crushed by a meteor and died
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man
Who never really gave a damn
Only thing he worked on was his tan
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man

My heart's in my throat, or is it a potato?

Your love sticks like a turkey bone in my throat
She's in my thoughts and it'll need a jolt to remove her
Before my expiration, I need resuscitation
Mouth to mouth
She throws water on my face, slaps my cheek
Helps me back on my stool
She's a waitress here, but in the night
She's a student at nursing school
She comes again with a smile and the bill
I pick it up and choke again
She's charged me for my lunch and for the medical procedure
I love you so much, I need the Hiemlich manuver
Your love sticks like a turkey bone in my throat
She's in my thoughts and it'll need a jolt to remove her

There's also Whippet Harbour, or maybe Butter Pot
Or maybe I'll just hit the pub I'm feeling like a shot
Well you can sail on Quidi Vidi, or look at Joe Batt's Arm
There's Placentia and there's Cow Head (MOOO!), they're so full of charm
Get married down in Kilbride, have a party in Hate Bay
Or have some screech in Fogo and forget about the day

'Cause now I'm getting all their royalties

They're gonna chew your welcome mat
Swallow your kitty cat
Reindeer coming and they're gonna eat your begonias
'Cause Santa hasn't fed them in a month
Santa's coming and he's gonna kick your ass
He's gonna kick your ass
He's gonna kick your ass
Santa's coming and he's gonna kick your ass
'Cause he's sick of shoveling snow and reindeer poo
Elves are coming and they're gonna steal your turkey
Wreck your TV
Burn down your Christmas tree
Elves are coming and they're gonna trash your home
'Cause they ain't got nothing else to do
Santa's loaded with attitude
He's loud and drunk and smelly and rude
His workshop's been closed by an auditor
And Mrs. Claus ran off with her chiropractor.

He's gonna kick your ass
He's gonna kick your ass

It sure is, man!
Hey, look at all them little cars going beside us.. Look how small they are!
They're so tiny! Oh yeah!
We have some great perspective from up here in our
WINNEBAGO!
Yeah, man, we got everything in here, man!
That's right.
I'm gonna make some coffee, man!
You making coffee?
You want some coffee?
I'm gonna make some photocopies!
Oh, can you make some for me?
Yeah, that'd be great!
And can you bind them for me, too?
Oh, you bet, we can do anything in our
WINNEBAGO!
You know what?
What?
I kinda got a hankering for a hot-tub.
A hot-tub! A hot-tub!
You know, I think I might go on back to the hot-tub and give my old bones a soak, you know what I'm saying?
Okay, well, man, don't you want to play some tennis first, man?
Tennis? Where are we going to play tennis?
On the top of our
WINNEBAGO!
Yeah!
Oh yeah! I forgot about that!
I just put that in by the helicopter pad!
That's.. Wow, the helicopter pad?
Oh yeah, man, just so we can get you and fly around, and that way we can be even higher and look down on our
WINNEBAGO!
You know what the funny thing about having a tennis court on top of our Winnebago
What's that, man?
Is you gotta be a pretty good tennis player, man!
Oh yeah, sure!
You don't wanna miss cause you'll lose your balls, you know what I mean?
Oh yeah! We got lots of balls!
That's true.
Lots of balls.
We could just fill this whole thing with balls, couldn't we?
Ahhhh yeah!
Oh yeah!
WINNEBAGO!
Hey, hey man, did you feel something man?
What do you mean, \"feel something\"?
I think.. I think we just ran over some sort of mini or something, man!
Oh no! Ha ha ha!
Oh look! There's a Honda Civic on our grill!
Man, those guys are small!
Oh yeah, really!
They're just no match for our
WINNEBAGO!
Yeah, that's right.
Hey, if you're still alive, come on up, buddy! Come on!
Come on, we need more people to fill up our Winnebago cause it's so huge, you know!
Oh yeah, man, you could put like, half of Taiwan in this place, man!
Yeah.
We should drive there, man!
Drive to Taiwan?
Well, sure, man!
WINNEBAGO!
This baby could do anything, you know..
Really?
Yeah, we'll just blow the tires up real big!
You know what? You know what I wanna do before we go to Taiwan?
What's that, man?
I wanna stop off at North Carolina and get some cheap smokes.
Yeah? Oh, that's a good idea, yeah..
We could go to Bob's Butt World, you know?
Oh yeah, he's got good butts, Bob.
He's got serious butts.
Yeah.
We could just fill our
WINNEBAGO!
Yeah, I'm just gonna go back to the smoking section now.
Talking about smoking, man, do you smell that?
Smell what?
Oh man! I left the turkey in the oven!
Oh no!
Oh no!
How are we gonna feed all these people?
I don't know, man!
We're gonna have to kick them out of our
WINNEBAGO!
See you later, suckers!
Yeah, we'll see you later, man!

Are you tired?
I think I'll go for a nap now.
Oh, in the.. in the waterbed?
No no, I was thinking of the four-poster.
Oh really? Well, I'm just gonna go to the wave pool.
Oh really?
Yeah.
Aren't you gonna drive? Someone has to drive.
What's that?
You have to drive!
Oh yeah.. I'll take the golf cart down there.
Eh, okay..no, I meant you have to drive our
Oh! You mean drive the Winnebago!
WINNEBAGO!
Yeah! Oh no, we're slowing down..
Yeah, I think
I think we're running out of gas!
I think our band is, you know, getting a little tired.
Yeah.
They were counting on that turkey, man!
It's tough to have a house band in your Winnebago, you know.
WINNEBAGO!
See, they wanted to play on that one!
I know!
But you screwed them up!
They're always coming in too fast, you know, man..
Or too late!
WINNEBAGO!
There they go again!
What was that one?
I'm getting so sick and tired of saying
WINNEBAGO!
It's a good word though, man, it rolls right off the tongue..
Man! Oh, oh..
You know, I heard that the Winnebagos are an Indian tribe, man.
Really?
Yeah!
An Indian tribe?
Yeah, they didn't ride no horses though, man..
Did they have ladders up the side of them?
Oh yeah! No no, they just drove around in
WINNEBAGOS!
You should have seen the cowboys when they came in and tried to take those Indians over, man!
Oh yeah! They took the bog W off for the Big W Ranch.
Yeah!
That's what I like to call my Winnebago sometimes is the Big W Ranch.
I don't know what you're talking about!
No, but I sure love my
WINNEBAGO!
Oh yeah!
Weren't you gonna go to bed sometime, man? I thought you were tired?
You know, I got my second wind.
Oh, you did?
That's cause this is my second Winnebago.
Oh, this is your second?
Yeah, sometimes I get tired
Uh-huh?
But then I just think of my
WINNEBAGO!
Oh yeah.. Yeah?
Sometimes.
Yeah.
You know what?
What?
I'm kinda tired again.
You really tired?
Yeah, I may go back to the West Wing.
Oh yeah man, it's nice out there!
You know what else starts with W?
What?
That word that we know?
What's that?
Ah, how do you say..
WINNEBAGO!
Oh, Winnebago! I thought you were going to say washing machine!
No, no.. well..
Cause I got my clothes in there
Yeah, you could afford to do a load, you know.
I think the butler's gonna get them for me though.
Really?
yeah.
That's a good idea. You know, the maid is mad at me.
Oh yeah? Why's that, man?
I pinched her ass.
Oh.
Yeah, that's right.
She had it coming.
That's right. Well, if you're gonna ride around on my
WINNEBAGO!
You're gonna get your ass pinched.
Oh, I'm glad you said Winnebago, I thought you were gonna say ride around on my something else!
No, nothing rude or nothing like that.
No, that's good.
Yeah man.
Wow.
Well, here's me tired again.
Aw, tired again, man?
Oh damn.
Well, you know..
You were saying?
What's that? Ah..
No, no, you go ahead. I shouldn't have interrupted you.
WINNEBAGO!
Yeah!
I think I'm gonna go now.
Where are you going?
I'm going on the jetski.
Oh really?
Yeah.
We could like, go out on jetskis, or maybe, you know.. I'm gonna ride the whale!
Oh, the whale!
Yeah, I'm gonna ride the humpback whale that's on the roof..
Yeah?
Near the tennis court, in the pool of our
WINNEBAGO!
Yeah, that's right, sometimes you have to hurry quick.
Yeah, I know.
Cause the band..
I'm getting tired, man. I'm getting tired of you, you know.
You know, we're going to have to pay the band overtime for keeping on playing.
Alright, no, they're good guys.
Yeah, they're good guys. They just wanna ride in our
WINNEBAGO!"
"1782" "Open my eyes, what a beautiful day
Just the type that makes me want to say hooray
I'm still a little fuzzy-headed from my sleep
Into my brain reality seeps
Look all around me, can't believe what I see
These little short people are surrounding me
I've got a white beard, a suit made of red
My soul becomes filled with a keen sense of dread
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus
Hop out of bed, kick an elf in the chest
What an awful way to awake from a rest
\"Santa, oh, Santa,\" the little gnomes cheer
\"You shouldn't be nasty at this time of year!\"
\"What do you mean?\" I say in a rage
\"And what are you doing with those big burlap bags?\"
The elves they do roar, \"Why their full of toys
For you to deliver to the good girls and boys.\"
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus
Resigned to my fate, I load up the sleigh
Harness the reindeer and get under way
It's nippy up here in the cool arctic sky
Good thing I remembered that bottle of rye
Flying over rooftops, throwing out toys
Hopefully crushing those good girls and boys
Like a bad dream, I pray for release
Please let this hellish existence be ceased!
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus
From this nightmare I finally awake
My brain is on fire, my hands they do shake
But wait, they're not hands, they're cute little paws
I'm the Easter Bunny, I'm not Santa Claus!
Oh God, I'm the Easter Bunny
Oh God, I 'm Easter Bunny

Thinks a meteorologist knows what falls from the sky
But he's got a steady income as a TV weather guy

I just read the temperatures and make up a bunch of lies

Thinks cloud are made from cotton that have blown up to the sky

On Saturdays I must be out of bed by five A.M.
Put on a ton of make-up and then stare at the camera lens
Greeting all the viewers with a \"Hi-hi-hip-hello!\"
'Cause it's the day I have to host a kiddie cartoon show
He smiles at the camera then to his puppet sock
He raves about the crayon drawings of the family dog
Did a promo at the shopping mall and made the children cry
He's a lousy clown but a good TV weather guy
They said that I'm not cute enough to be an anchorman
Not tough enough for sports and for the arts I was too bland
But I know that some day I will reach my TV goal
When I guest star on Baywatch or 90210
'Til then I'll smile at the camera and tell a little joke

At Wong's, come and sail with me

Fourth plate. Ooooohh. Dessert. Uuuuuuugg.

Can barely stand, I tell you man, I got my money's worth

Scariest guy to ever wet a bed
He had hands on his arms and eyes on his head
But they weren't his
He'd go down to the market and try to scare the fish
He said that they bothered him, they weren't his favorite dish
Then he'd go down to the highway and pretend that he was dead
That just the way he was, creepy scary Ned
Ooohh oohhhhh Scary Ned
Ned loved Halloween 'cause he didn't need a mask
He'd steal the children's candy, he didn't even ask
He'd sit right down in front of them and then he'd start to eat
He'd tell them they were better off 'cause that stuff can rot your teeth
Ooohh oohhhhh ooohh oohhhhh Scary Ned
A strange glow would come from his place late into the night
He'd watch T.V. 'til the dawn, you know that ain't right
If he started to get tired he'd rub sauerkraut on his head
That's just the kind of guy he was, good old scary Ned
Ooohh oohhhhh ooohh oohhhhh ooohh oohhhhh Scary Ned
He had a face his mother didn't love
When people saw on the street they often said \"Uughh!\"
Sometimes late at night he'd walk alone
He'd be reciting stuff
Bad sounding stuff
Icky awful stuff
But when you got to know him, he weren't so bad
Ooohh oohhhhh Scary Ned
Ooohh oohhhhh ooohh oohhhhh ooohh oohhhhh Scary Ned
Ooohh oohhhhh Scary Ned [this repeats to end over talking- K]

You don't want to know what I'm thinking, girl.
Or... or do you?
Girl, you think I'm the bomb,
but I'm old enough to be dating your mom. And I did.
She wasn't that bad, but you're grounded if you tell your dad
that you like the way we dance, with rock-hard abs and plastic pants.
You give us teddy bears,
and in return we shave our chest hairs. Yeah, we're so manly.
'Cause we're singing in a boy band.
The words are stupid, and the music's bland.
Never see a dime for selling out to the man.
Yeah, we're a boy band.
We say we met in church, but we're a product to market research.
We sing about sex, to little girls who shouldn't think about sex yet.
It's not like they listen, it's not like they care.
'Cause when we sweat our bodies glisten.
We like the color blue. (blue, blue)
And we're appearing at a mall near you, right beside the food court.
'Cause we're singing in a boy band.
The words are stupid, and the music's bland.
No one likes us here, but we're big in Japan.
Yeah, we're a boy band.
Throw your hands up in the air,
and wave them around like you just don't care.
You just don't care, you just don't care,
now bring your hands down from the air.
Doo doo doot doot doot, doo doo doot doot doot
Doo doo doot doot doot, doo doo doot doot doot
Doo doo doot doot doot, doo doo doot doot doot
Doo doo doot doot doot, doo doo doot doot doot
Doo doo doot ahh ahh ahh ahh.
'Cause we're singing in a boy band.
The words are stupid and the music's bland.
Another pollutant in the pop wasteland.
Yeah, we're a boy band.

Yeah, we're a boy band."
"1793" "My country's bigger than most
And if asked I boast
'Cause I'm really proud
So I shout it loud
Though our numbers are few
We will welcome you
Although we don't have history
Gold medal winning teams
Heroes or prisoners
World famous volcanoes
Still what we've got's glorious
'Cause we've got rocks and trees
And trees and rocks, and rocks and trees
And trees and rocks, and rocks and trees
And trees and rocks, and rocks and trees
And trees and rocks, and water
All right, everyone
We've got rocks and trees
And trees and rocks, and rocks and trees

"1794" "There won't be any presents this Christmas
No goodies in your stocking
The milk and cookies that the children left out
Will be left untouched beside the sink
The reindeer will be staying in their pens this year
The elves haven't built any thing
'Cause Santa got arrested
Last Christmas Day
Police got calls on 911
About a red-suited man who weighed a ton
There was a clear trail of evidence pointing north
This was the seventh time it happened on December 24th
The Mounties reached the North Pole
They found it was outside their jurisdiction
They called up Interpol, the Finnish police
To facilitate the suspect's extradition
They knocked on the door of a well-marked shop
With a warrant for the owner's apprehension
Then Santa got arrested
Christmas Day
Santa was charged with B&E;
His council advised he plead guilty
There was footage of the crime running on TV
And photographs of little children sitting on his knee"
"1795" "I'm out on the range, surveying the land
Thinking of the job that's to be done
My life is hard but I don't mind
Men like me, that's how the west was won
I stand the pain and the suffering
For on the trail I am the king
On doors I knock and on bells I ring
Always sure that I will get the sale
'Cause I am Dan the Insurance Salesman
In a beat-up Chevrolet I do ride
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally
And on the dotted line I make them sign
Hi-de-hey (Hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey) hey!
The door swings wide and I sense my prey
Ready to fall victim to my pitch
I tell him all about the plan
With all of its inherent benefits
If you lose an arm it's a thousand bucks
Lose both of them and get twice as much
And if you should die, well then, bless your luck
You'll just be raking in the cash
'Cause I am Dan the Insurance Salesman
In a beat-up Chevrolet I do ride
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally
And on the dotted line I make them sign
Hi-de-hey (Hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey) hey!
The sucker signs, the deed is done
It's time for me to get back on the road
A lonely man out on the land
Where the wind can blow so cold
I ride into the setting sun
With the knowledge of a job well done
But I can't rest until everyone
Has become properly insured
'Cause I am Dan the Insurance Salesman
In a beat-up Chevrolet I do ride
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally
And on the dotted line I make them sign
Hi-de-hey (Hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey) hey!

"1796" "I had a love that was so bright
I used to dream of her each night
And then rush to her side every morning (oooh)
I had her all to myself
We never noticed anyone else
We didn't even hear the radio warnings
Our love was no joke, you know
It was the talk of downtown Tokyo
We'll be happy forever, I promised her
But just as I proposed, her feet
Were made to touch her nose
As she was crushed by a Japanese monster
(ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-AAAAAAGH! GODZILLA!)
Our love was so true
But now she's 3 foot 2
And she used to be 5 foot 11
Her death was unintentional
But now she's 2-dimensional
My angel is truly in heaven
She's the one I kiss and hug
Till she was crushed like a bug
I guess it's hard to see a monster above you
She said she'd save her heart for me
But now it's there for all to see
And her last words to me were, \"I AAAAAGGHH!\"
Our love was so true
But now she's 3 foot 2
And she used to be 5 foot 11
Her death was unintentional
But now she's 2-dimensional
My angel is truly in heaven
(Take it George!)
[Guitar solo consisting entirely of glissandos]
She was young (so young)
And sweet (so sweet)
But now she's part (she's part)
Of the street (the street)
And I want (so much)
To have her back (come back)
So I'll get a putty knife
So I can scrape her from the crack
(Oh. You might need a wider brush.)
Our love was so true
But now she's 3 foot 2
And she used to be 5 foot 11

"1798" "I met you in biology in high school
You told me after college we'd be wed
You were my favorite lab partner
Till you ran off with that brilliant young pre-med
My pain would show up on a cat-scan
My optic nerves are only seeing blue
My blood hates to flow
Because it has to go
Through the four-chambered heart that cries for you
I'm in the lonely lab of broken hearts
I dissect the way you say goodbye until it falls apart
I'm in the lonely lab of feelin' blue
And my pheremones can find no trace of you
You were as sweet as crystalline carbohydrates
The rods and cones in my optical receptors are filled with tears
I wanted to elope
So we could make some isotopes
With a half-life of a million thousand years
If I suspended my trachial dilations till you returned here
My muscles would need atipianarobic respiration
Adenine, cidozine, guanine, and thianine
Might make up my DNA
But my love gene must be missin' from its station
I'm in the lonely lab of broken hearts
I dissect the way you say goodbye until it falls apart
I'm in the lonely lab of feelin' blue
And my pheremones can find no trace of you
The metallurgist is the musicians best friend. This statement
has been echoed throughout the ages, for without the metallurgist, we
could not have such musical things as triangles, cymbals, margerine
tubs, or guitar strings. Guitar strings are produced by the
wire-drawing process, where solid metal is pulled through dies with
progressively smaller diameters, until the desired diameter, or guage,
is reached. The ability to be drawn into wires is called ductility,
and seperates metals from other materials, such as wood, ceramics, or
plastic milk jugs, which are made by the blow-molding process. You
put the milk in later.

I dissect the way you say goodbye until it falls apart

"1799" "Once a year we celebrate
With stupid hats and plastic plates
The fact that you were able to make
Another trip around the sun
And the whole clan gathers round
And gifts and laughter do abound
And we let out a joyful sound
And sing that stupid song
Happy birthday!
Now you're one year older!
Happy birthday!
Your life still isn't over!
Happy birthday!
You did not accomplish much
But you didn't die this year
I guess that's good enough
So let's drink to your fading health
And hope you don't remind yourself
The chance of finding fame and wealth
Decrease with every year
Does it feel like you're doing laps
And eating food and taking naps
And hoping that someday perhaps
Your life will hold some cheer
Happy birthday!
What have you done that matters?
Happy birthday!
You're starting to get fatter
Happy birthday!
It's downhill from now on
Try not to remind yourself
Your best years are all gone
If cryogenics were all free
Then you could live like Walt Disney
And live for all eternity
Inside a block of ice
But instead your time is set
This is the only life you get
And though it hasn't ended yet
Sometimes you wish it might
Happy birthday!
You wish you had more money
Happy birthday!
Your life's so sad it's funny
Happy birthday!
How much more can you take?
But your friends are hungry
So just cut the stupid cake
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!

They went down to Florida to laugh and dance and play
Bill went in for a swim, he didn't see the harm
But when he came back out again, he was short an arm
'Cause Rippy the Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!
Rippy the Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!
Passing the time by ending children's lives
Down in the bottom of the swamp, swamp, swamp!
Billy and his father went out to play some catch
But Billy missed the pass because his arm was unattached
The ball flew past his shoulder and it rolled into the swamp
When he went wading after it his leg became a stump
'Cause Rippy the Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!
Rippy the Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!
Passing the time by ending children's lives
Down in the bottom of the swamp, swamp, swamp!
Billy and his father joined a three-legged race
They were tearing up the field, no one could keep the pace
But Billy tripped and did a flip and landed in the muck
He was running out of limbs and also out of luck
'Cause Rippy the Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!
Rippy the Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!
Passing the time by ending children's lives
Down in the bottom of the swamp, swamp, swamp!
Billy was all dirty, he really had to wash
But he couldn't use a towel 'cause his limbs had been gnawed off
He went into the water to get all clean and bright
But when his bath was finished he was only half his height
'Cause Rippy the Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!
Rippy the Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!
Passing the time by ending children's lives
Down in the bottom of the swamp, swamp, swamp!
Billy's father rolled his wheelchair up upon a hill
He wanted to put Bill where he would not get killed
But he left him on a slope, and into the swamp he rolled
They dragged out his head but there was nothing left below
'Cause Rippy the Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!
Rippy the Gator went chomp, chomp, chomp!

"1802" "I once was a happy man of sound and stable mind
Then my neighbour bought a dog
He put a ribbon on its head to make it cute
But it still looked like a chihuahua
He had me over to watch it sit and beg
It bit my knee, and made love to my leg
Now it barks all the night and all of the day
Whenever it's not peeing on my lawn
I didn't get to sleep last night till very late
The stupid dog barked and grrrr'd
I got up late for work and ran to catch the bus
But I slipped on a turd
I was certain it wasn't one of mine
That that dog had crossed over the line
I wanted to exterminate it and all its kind
From my lovely little suburb
I'm gonna kill the dog next door
Ain't gonna bark anymore
'Cause this is Judgment Day
And the little runt has got to pay
No more turds on my lawn
That stupid mutt will soon be gone
Gonna kill kill kill kill kill kill kill that dog
I see the little monster in my garden
So I grab an axe and off I go
And I try my best to get it
All I do is sever my big toe
My neighbour comes outside to call me
He says his dog and me should just be friends
He puts his little pet in my forgiving hands
Then it starts to bite
So I strangle it with all my might
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
I'm gonna kill the dog next door (kill the dog next door)
Ain't gonna bark anymore
'Cause this is Judgment Day
And the little runt has got to pay
No more turds on my lawn (doo-doos on my lawn)
That stupid mutt will soon be gone
Gonna kill kill kill kill kill kill kill that dog
Now the stupid mutt's in doggy heaven
I strangled it to death and now I'm free
But my trouble ain't quite over
My neighbour called the cops on me
I end up at the police station
Where I am told that I must pay
A 300 dollar fine
Wow, what a good value
I think I'll kill my neighbour too!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
I'm gonna kill the guy next door (kill the guy next door)
Won't call the cops anymore
I never liked him anyway
300 isn't much to pay
There are turds on my lawn (doo-doos on my lawn)
They must be his, his dog is gone
Gonna kill kill kill kill kill kill kill

"1803" "Christmas makes me realize how greatly things do change
Friends lose touch, people age, and family moves away
But it is what had stayed the same that gives me the most tears
For I've had the same Christmas cake for almost thirty years
Granny made it back in sixty-eight and gave it to my mom
Who gave it to her uncle who gave it to her son
Who then gave it to me and that is where it stuck
For I was only three months old and clearly out of luck
Each Christmas of my childhood that fruit-brick would return
My mom would place it on a plate and tell me I must learn
That it is rude to get a gift and not put it to use
And every year I'd take a bite and chip another tooth
After fifteen years of misery I'd had all I could take
That summer I went camping and dropped it in the lake
I thought that I was rid of it, but on Christmas eve
There it was \"from Santa Claus\" under the Christmas tree
Each year I'd try to lose it but it would just return
So I cried out \"oh why have I been given such a burden?\"
A voice replied, \"it's not a curse, but the greatest gift\"
\"For when all else abandons you, you will still have it.\"
For all of man's creations slowly waste away
Relationships do crumble and buildings do decay
The pyramids and stonehenge slowly disappear
But if they were made of Christmas cake they'd last a million years"

For debauchery may be fun and entertaining
But it is also very bad for you

Making love to someone who has not had all their tests
So nowadays, I am celibate
And I wear a condom, in case I have dirty thoughts
I never drive my car past the speed limit
And I always wear my seat belt when I am in it

Being boring is the way to go!
Ay-yi-yi! Ay-yi-yo!
Having fun is bad for you!
I can no longer smoke my cigarettes
Because I found that they are a major cause of death
The tar and nicotine have not killed me yet
But if I got pregnant, they could hurt my baby
I used to love my swarthy complexion
I tanned myself to perfection
But the sun can give you a cancerous infection
So now I'm white and pasty and I never leave the house
I used to eat like there was no tomorrow
But then I found cholesterol is full of sorrow
The last thing I want to do is to have to borrow
Somebody else's heart, because mine is full of fatty deposits

I can't tell you just what happened but it did
I grew six inches in one day
It's painful when it goes that way
And now my skinny body's really achin'
And my skin just exploded
With an inch of oil it's loaded
It's so greasy you could fry a pound of bacon

I'm such a tall and awkward geek
I fall down when I try to play a grounder
At dinner every night I eat
A giant heaping plate of meat
Then go out with my friends for quarter pounders
And weird emotions come alive
My hormones are in overdrive
I've turned into a girl-watching creature
And all my friends their marks are shot
But they don't care because they're hot
For Mrs. Smith the mathematics teacher
My voice is changing
I hate to hear it crack
I pray to God I won't inherit
Dad's hairy back
My voice is changing
When will it end?
And when will mom stop kissing me
In front of all my friends?
Pretty soon I bet I'll
Be right into heavy metal
But my parents say at least it isn't rap
I'll start wearing stupid clothes
And threaten that I'll pierce my nose
And tell my parents all they like is crap
The first girl that I ever kiss
Will be the one and who could miss
Our love forever written in the stars?
But I don't think our love will last
Unless the four years go by fast
Till I can use the backseat of the car

I want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger
I want a manly physique
I put down the cheetos and I went on a crash diet
(carrots were all you ate)
Then I noticed that my skin was turning orange
(you're just a big mistake)
Then I overdosed on diet pills
(too bad you did not die)
Still I want to look like my idol
(the great big beefy guy)
I want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger
I don't want to be fat and weak, oh no, oh no
I want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger
I want a manly physique
I bought myself a weight set and some steriods
(to make you big and strong)
And I worked out really really hard
(but it did not last for long)
I put out my back, and the steroids made me sterile
(not like it mattered anyway)
And about looking like my hero
(he has one thing to say)
I don't want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger
I don't mind being fat and weak, oh no, oh no
I don't want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger
It's easier being fat and lazy
You'll never look like Arnold Schwartzenegger
You'll always be fat and weak, oh yes, oh yes
You'll never look like Arnold Schwartzenegger
You are fat and ugly"
"1810" "Dad threw up on Christmas Day
He puked on the serving tray
The stuffing's come right out of Daddy dear
Now everybody's Christmas vacation
Will be filled with a viral infection
Maybe we'll all be better by next year
We felt more than a breeze
When Daddy had to sneeze
It didn't sound a lot like Ah-Choo
Mom was saying grace
When Daddy barked on her face
So Mom asked God to bless the vomit too
Dad threw up on Christmas Day
He got some chunks on Uncle Ray
Who kept on talking about his pancreas
We'll all remember Christmas Eve
As the last time we were free of disease
And able to digest some solid food"
"1811" "Me work hard 5 days a week/
Sweeping garbage from the street.
Come home not want book to read/
Not 'nuff pictures for me see.
Sit right down in favourite chair/
Wearing only underwear.
Favourite night is Saturday night/
'Cause me can watch hockey fights!
Me Like Hockey!
Me Like Hockey!
Me not like pro basketball/
'Cause me short and they all tall.
Baseball slow like Forrest Gump/
'Cept when Robby spits on ump.
Wrestlemania not so great/
Me like to see Hulk Hogan skate.
TV soccer not so hot/
You play bad then you get shot.
Me Like Hockey!
Me Like Hockey!
Swedish players must be geeks/
'Cause they still got own real teeth.
Not like Finnish players names/
What's a Teemu anyways?
Russians worse in history/
Got stupid names like Valery.
Me like Sergei Federov/
Me like him more if head were off!
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Me Like Hockey!
Me Like Hockey!

"1813" "The holidays are over, you've gained twenty pounds
The cat's choking on tinsel, pine needles stalk the ground
There are no cards in the mailbox, just a stack of bills
Yes, the holidays are over and you are feeling ill
Have a happy Christmas hangover
It's the most miserable time of the year
The eggnog's made you fat, the party is over
'Cept for your wacky Uncle who is still drinking your beer
Turkey's great on Christmas bur after a whole month
Of turkey pie stew and pie you start to dread lunch
Breakfast is much scarier 'cause all there is to eat
Is fourteen Christmas cakes and a bag of cranberries
Have a happy Christmas hangover
It's the most miserable time of the year
Your uncle's in the bathroom and granny's on the sofa
And you start to wish that they'd just disappear
You ate too many liquor-filled chocolates
Got no money left in your pockets
But at least you got lots of
Ugly sweaters and bow ties and socks
(And twenty-two calenders!)
You're skin is pale and pasty, your energy is spent
Along with all the money you need to pay the rent
The children are all crying ''cause they've broken all their toys
Is this misery worth one day of joy?
Have a happy Christmas hangover
It's the most miserable time of the year
Your uncle has passed out on granny on the sofa
And you start to wish that you could disappear
And you start to wish that you cold disappear"
"1814" "Chorus
Christmas is almost here (x3)
Aaahhhggggrrr!
It's just five days till Christmas, I haven't done a thing
Don't even have a Christmas tree, I am panicking
Most lots are all sold out, I search until the night
I end up with a grubby shrub with a case of blight
CHORUS
It's four days till Christmas, still have to decorate
Spend hours in the basement until I find the crate
Of lights and bulbs and popcorn strings, tangled in a knot
Then I spend the day separating what I've got
CHORUS
It's three days till Christmas, I spent all day writing cards
I started writing letters now I just say \"best regards\"
I shove 'em in a mailbox and to the mall I go
To get gifts for Jim and Jane and Tim and Uncle Joe (and aunt Mavis and Grandma and
....)
CHORUS
Two days till Christmas, a million things to do
Clean the house, put on tea, company is due
Where are my in-laws, they should have shown up
I bet they're at the airport I forgot to pick them up
CHORUS (x4)
Christmas is here
It's finally Christmas, the kids wake me up at five
I fall downstairs a messy haired zombie, half-alive
Spend all day serving company, then fall down inert
If these are my holidays I'd rather stay at work"
"1815" "The best things in life are not free
But you don't need to have money
To get the things that you want to own
You just have to get a loan
When you buy, small or large
Just put it on your credit card
You can live like a king
Not paying for a single thing
Put it on credit and then forget it
Don't let it bother you no more no more
Put it on credit and then forget it
And go back to the store
Every night, I pray and thank
God above for creating the banks
They have been so kind to me
With their boundless generosity
If you cannot make your payments
Well, do like the national governments
You can pay off what you owe
By taking out a bigger loan
Ya gotta put it on credit and then forget it
Don't let it bother you no more no more
Put it on credit and then forget it
And go back to the store
Now I seem to have men after me
From the collection agency
And the bank came by the other day
Took everything I own away
Now I think that it is plain to see
That I must declare bankruptcy
But things aren't really all that bad
I can borrow from my dad!
And put it on credit and then forget it
Don't let it bother you no more no more
Put it on credit and then forget it
And go back to the store
Ya gotta put it on credit and then forget it
Don't let it bother you no more no more
Put it on credit and then forget it
And go back to the store"
"1816" "Listen up brothers and sisters, come hear my desperate tale
I speak of our friends of nature, trapped in the dirt like a jail
Vegetables live in oppression, served on our tables each night
The killing of veggies is madness, I say we take up the fight
Salads are only for murderers, coleslaw's a fascist regime
Don't think that they don't have feelings, just 'cause a radish can't
scream
CHORUS
I've heard the screams of the vegetables (scream scream
scream)
Watching their skins being peeled (Having their insides
revealed)
Grated and steamed with no mercy (burning off calories)
How do you think that feels (bet it hurts really bad)
Carrot Juice constitutes murder (and that's a real crime)
Greenhouses prisons for slaves (let my vegetables grow)
It's time to stop all this gardening (it's as dirty as hell)
Let's call a spade a spade (is a spade is a spade...)
I saw a man eating celery, so I beat him black and blue
If he ever touches a sprout again, I'll bite him clean in two
I'm a political prisoner trapped in a windowless cage
'cause I stopped the slaughter of turnips by killing five men in a
rage
I told the judge when he sentenced me, this is my finest hour
I'd kill those farmers again just to save one more cauliflower
CHORUS
How low as people do we dare to stoop
Making young broccolis bleed in the soup
Untie your beans, uncage your tomatoes, let potted plants free
Don't mash that potato
I've heard the screams of the vegetables (scream scream
scream)
Watching their skins being peeled (fates in the stir fry are
sealed)"
"1817" "Well me n' my buddies we got us some beer
And a great big bottle of rye
And boxes of ammo and guns to go with 'em
And good old Charlie's glass eye
Well we looked all around so we sees all of nature
So calm and so serene
But not for long 'cause we're gonna use our guns
To make furry animals scream
'Cause we're goin' huntin'
We're gonna kill somethin'
I don't care what it is
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,
maybe the neighbour's kids!
We're goin' huntin'
We're gonna kill somethin'
I don't care what it is
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,
maybe the neighbour's kids!
Well off we go, our guns are loaded
And so's are we
We weaves through the bushes and falls on our faces
And piss on the nice trees
And then we spot something moving in on us
We pump it full of lead
And smile real wide as we hear it scream
And thud as it falls down dead
'Cause we're goin' huntin'
We're gonna kill somethin'
I don't care what it is
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,
maybe the neighbour's kids!
We're goin' huntin'
We're gonna kill somethin'
I don't care what it is
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,
maybe the neighbour's kids!
Well off we go to see what we killed
And watch the damn thing bleed
The first thing we see is a bright orange cap
And we shot down Ol' Charlie
But he don't too mind, he smiled all the time
He died real happy
But next time he should tell us
When he's goin' off to take a pee
'Cause we're goin' huntin'
We're gonna kill somethin'
I don't care what it is
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,
maybe the neighbour's kids!
We're goin' huntin'
We're gonna kill somethin'
I don't care what it is
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,
maybe the neighbour's kids!
Well the sun it goes down and we head back to town
And we hop in our pickup truck
Strap Charlie to the hood, n' start up the engine
Try n' get home with any luck
Well what do you know, we run 'to a pole
But we're all still in one piece
And we get a free ride back into town
Courtesy of the police.
'Cause we're goin' huntin'
We're gonna kill somethin'
I don't care what it is
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,
maybe the neighbour's kids!
We're goin' huntin'
We're gonna kill somethin'
I don't care what it is
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,
maybe the neighbour's kids!"

"1819" "From the deepest, darkest depths of...Whitby!
Comes this sordid tale of speed...
Murderous mayhem..
Cataclysmic combustion...
Picturesque powered pistons...
Accellerating automotive alarms...
Stunningly stupifying stereo stunts!
One man...a dream...a car...a 1984...Plymouth...HORIZON...
I loved the car from tail to grill
I wouldn't change a thing
I wouldn't trade the ashtray
For the Queen's engagement ring
But things they started going wrong
And went from bad to worse
The clutch went kinda funny
Then I couldn't use reverse
Still I loved my baby
And would not admit defeat
Just because it left a trail
Of rust along the street
It kept on running bravely
On duct tape and a prayer
Plus a monthly tribute to
The guy who did repairs
It all seems so unfair (That was back the day he bought)
Horizon!
Horizon!
Till one day on the parking lot
They called four-oh-one
My car became the meat between
A Buick-Honda bun
I saw some parts go flying
That you really need to drive
My car had become roadkill
Though it never was alive
Left a muffler in the passing lane
A hubcap in the slow
The windshield on the median
A headlight in the snow
And as I skidded off the road
The other drivers laughed
My middle-finger greeting
Would be my epitaph
Death would come at last (Here lies the man who dared to drive)
Horizon!
Now I look at my bent fender
The twisted wheel rim
I wonder if Horizon
Will ever drive again
But I know that this was not the end
Road warriors die hard
And I signed Mister Iacocca's
Organ donor card
The steel will get recycled
And they'll build another car
Bigger, faster, stronger
An automotive star
My quest will then begin
And revenge will soon be mine
As I drive my gleaming three-door
Orange Chrysler Frankenstein
Searching for that Buick
To try to end its days
We'll settle up that score
And then we'll drive away (The sun will rise again on the)
Horizon!
My Horizon!
My Horizon!"
"1820" "Scott became famous for freezing to death in Antartica.
Columbus made history thinking some island was India.
General Custer's a national hero for not knowing when to run.
All these men are famous, and they're also very dumb.
History is made by stupid people.
Clever people wouldn't even try.
If you wanna place in the history books,
Then do something dumb before you die.
Nobility are famous for no reason.
Marie Antoinette enjoyed her cake.
She cause a Revolution when she would not share.
And her husband lost his head for that mistake.
The Hindenberg was a giant zeppelin.
Her makers made a minor oversight.
Before they filled it up with explosive gas
They should have fixed the no smoking light.

Sitting there watching MAD T.V.
Just remember you should be quite grateful
At least they're not making history.

"1821" "When I look around me, I can't believe what I see
It seems as if this country has lost its will to live
The economy is lousy, we barely have an army
But we can still stand proudly 'cause Canada's really big
We're the second largest country on this planet earth
And if Russia keeps on shrinking then soon we'll be
first
(As long as we keep Quebec)
The USA has tanks and Switzerland has banks
They can keep them thanks, they just don't amount
'cause when you get down to it, you find out what the truth
is
It isn't what you do with it its the size that counts
Most people will tell you that France is pretty large
But you can put fourteen France's into this land of ours
(It'd take a lot of work, It'd take a whole lot of work)
We're larger than Malaysia, almost as big as Asia
We're bigger than Australia and it's a continent
So big we seldom bother to go see one another
Though we often go to other countries for vacations
Our mountains are very pointy, our prairies are not
The rest is kinda bumpy, but man do we have a lot
(we've got a lot of land, we've got a whole lot of land)
So stand up and be proud and sing out very loud
We stand out from the crowd 'cause Canada's really big"
"1822" "It's early in the morning, way before dawn
I down a cup of coffee put my lucky hat on
Get down to the water, before all the crowds
Gonna have more fun than the law allows
With my hot rod, I go out to prove
When I'm on the prowl, I never lose
I fire up my Merc and put the throttle down
'Cause I've got the fastest fishing boat in town
I open up my tackle box, it's so big!
Crank baits, sink baits, beer and jigs
Got my bobbers on, and my 10 pound test
Gonna catch me a lunker gonna be the best
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna have some fun
(Gonna go fishing) 'Cause it's number one
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna sit on my butt
(Gonna catch a fish) And scrape out its guts
Ahhh, fishing!
I fish on the lake, by the sunken tree stump
Between the sewage output, and the chemical dump
Don't swim in the lake, says a sign on a tree
It's a good thing that fish can't read
I got my 10 dollar lure, the one that floats
And I make a big cast from my 20 grand boat
With my thousand dollar rod, or maybe it's more
Gonna catch me a fish that's 5 bucks at the store
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna have some fun
(Gonna go fishing) 'Cause it's number one
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna sit on my butt
(Gonna catch a fish) And scrape out its guts
Ahhh, fishing!
I feel something tugging on the end of my line
(Tug, tug, tug, tug, tug that line)
I'm gonna catch a fish, it's gonna be so fine
(Fish, fish, fish, fish, fish so fine)
Oh it feels so good to touch fish slime

There's nothing else to do with my free time

"1823" "I never much believed in reincarnation
Thought it was only people's imagination
But now I'm forced into some reconsideration
'Cause something's happened to my cat
That deserves some explanation
William Shakespeare's in my cat
My kitty is the bard
He used to be a playwright
Now he's digging up the yard
He's still a cat in most respects
He likes to meow and purr
But now I introduce him as the cat
That wrote Richard the third
I took him to see Phantom
He said it was quite nice
But he can't go see Miss Saigon
Until he kills some mice
(Until he kills some mice)
William Shakespeare's in my cat
It sometimes seems so deep
The guy who wrote Twelfth Night
Chews on my socks while I'm asleep
I'm really quite impressed
I own the cat who wrote MacBeth
But if something's rotten in this state
It's just his fishy breath
'Cause he wrote Romeo and Juliet
But his greatest story yet
Is coming back as someone's pet
And gettin' neutered by the vet
He got his paws caught in a net
Then he said to be or not to meeeow!
William Shakespeare's in my cat
He rarely ever talks
He makes his loudest statements
Standing in the litter box
He sleeps on all my shelves
And throws my books about the house
It doesn't sound like prose
When he bats a squeaky mouse
Sam Beckett's plays are witty,
Same thing for Bernard Shaw,
Oscar Wilde is pretty,
But none of them have paws
(None of them have paws)
William Shakespeare's in my cat
He chases bits of fluff
John Milton's in my goldfish
But I never liked his stuff
I'm thinking that Franz Kafka
Really came back as a bug
And I hope Andrew Lloyd Webber
Will stay underneath my rug
'Cause he wrote Romeo and Juliet
But his greatest story yet
Is coming back as someone's pet
And gettin' neutered by the vet
He got his paws caught in a net
Then he said to be or not to meeeow!
Take it, Trevor!
He wrote Romeo and Juliet
But his greatest story yet
Is coming back as someone's pet
And gettin' neutered by the vet
He got his paws caught in a net
Then he said to be or not to meeeow!"
"1824" "This year at Christmas, everybody's feeling funny
No one's making joyful sounds
Cranberry sauce ain't staying down
The lineups at the bathroom are longer than at the mall
Everybody's meeting Vincent
the Christmas Virus
Vincent the Christmas Virus
He's the one that'll keep you up all night
He's the festive parasite
Vincent the Christmas Virus
Vincent the Christmas Virus is resistant to penicillin
Doesn't notice Aspirin
Don't matter if you're fit and trim
But Vincent's not immune to the effects of alcohol
So get real drunk on Christmas Day
Let's all toast to Vincent (Hooray!)"
"1825" "ooooh come back proud Canadians
To before you had TV
No hockey night in canada!
There was no CBC (oh my god)
In 1812 Maddison was mad
He was the president you know
well he thought he'd tell the British
Where they aught to go
He thought he'd invade canada
He thought that he was tough
Instead we went to washingon...
[chorus]
And burned down all his stuff!
And the white house burned burned burned down
And we're the ones that did it
It burned burned burned
while the president ran and cried
It burned burned burned down
And things were very historical
and the americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies yeah
wah wah wah!
In the war of 1812
Us Hillbillies from Kentucky
Dressed in green and red
Left home to fight in Canada
But the returned home dead
Its the only war the Yankees lost
Except for Vietnam
And also the alamo
and the bay of... Ham
The loser was america
the winner was ourselves
so join right in and gloat about
the war of 1812
[chorus]
In 1812 we were just sittin around
Puttin crops into the ground
we heard the soldiers coming and we didnt like that sound
so we took a boat to washington
and burned it to the ground
ooooh we fired our guns but the yankees kept-a-comin
There wasn't quite as many as there was a while ago
we fired once more and the yankees started runnin
Down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
They ran through the snow and they ran through the forest
They ran through the bushes where the beavers wouldnt go
The ran so fast they forgot to take their culture
Back to America and the gulf of mexico-oo-oo-ooo
so if you go to washington
its buildings clean and nice
bring a pack of matches
and we'll burn the white house twice
and the whitehouse burned burned burned
but the americans wont admit it
it burned burned burned
it burned it burned it burned
it burned burned burned
how that made them mad
and the americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies

"1826" "One year I got a dog for Christmas
and I gave it to the boy next door
Then I gave him my bike and my mom's bank card
'cause that's what Christmas is for
I used to give a lot at Christmas
You might say I gave to much
Until my family was broke and we had no place to live
That's why, Christmas Sucks
I went down to the mall each Christmas
had to the Santa what to bring
A train, a bike, a pony and a great big pile of cash
and please don't get my sister anything
But the shopping mall Santa has been drinking
His nose is red from years of drinking scotch
He probably won't remember what's on my Christmas list
This Father Christmas sucks
Chorus:
Christmas Sucks, Christmas Sucks
Getting stuff is much for fun, you gotta look out for number one
Christmas Sucks
Christmas became worse as years went by
It was the most dreaded time of year
My parents got me clothes that just weren't cool
When all I want is money to buy beer
There was a girl at church who I was sweet on
So in the Christmas play I was the ox
I really think she liked me til I stepped on Baby Jesus
Even for our savious Christmas Sucks
Chorus
Now that I am thirty-wight years old
The only things I get are ties and socks
My kids are never happy with what's under the tree
Soon they'll understand Christmas Sucks
Every freakin' year Christmas Sucks
Christmas Sucks, Christmas Sucks, Christmas Sucks"
"1827" "Christmas is here, where did the time go?
Got to load up the reindeer, put on my red suit and go
I use to like Christmas, but every year it gets worse
Getting gift to six billion people is just too much damn work
Got the Christmas blues, man this job is killing me
And most of these stupid new houses don't even have chimneys
I use to be jolly, now I'm depressed
Had a twinkle in my eye, now I've got a bullet proof vest
'cause if the pace don't kill me, some gun totting yahoo will
They keep shooting at me like I'm some sort of big fat red criminal
Got the Christmas blues, I'm starting to see
That I gotta be some sort of loser to get paid in milk and cookies
I've grown to hate kids, especially their mail
Always asking me for stuff, well guess what I don't care, oh
Maybe I'm getting cranky as I get old
'cause I feel like giving them all a big lump of coal
Got the Christmas blues, man, enough is enough
Next year you can find some other sucker to deliver this stuff
Got the Christmas blues, I tell you I'm gonna quit
And find me a steady job with good benefits"

Heather solves her problems with drugs and Alcohol
Daniel solves his problems with a doctor and the law

Malcolm solves his problems with a chainsaw
Malcolm solves his problems with a chainsaw

Rancid marble cheese or a steak that's second rate
Awful TV programs or a broken ELvis plate
Or his fiancee who dumps him because he's gaining weight

"1829" "When Christmas rolls around Santa's busy in his shop
Managing his elves and trying to cut costs
His plant is out of date it needs modernization
He has quite a large debt accumulation
Elves are expensive, they do not come cheap
And you would not believe the bills for the heat
Santa stands to lose everything he owns
If he defaults on yet another of his loans
Things are looking bad for Santa
He can slip down chimneys but he can't balance accounts
Things are looking bad for Santa
If he wrote a cheque it probably would bounce
He hires an accountant to come and advise
The accountant says that he has been unwise
'cause even if the costs were cut down drastically
It's still hard to make money giving things away for free
Santa Claus decides to wipe the slate clean
He lays off half the elves and buys mordern machines
Then he auctions off all unnecessary stock
He gets a lot for Rudolf from Ripley's believe it or not
Things are looking bad for Santa
He's made all sorts of changes but it hasn't fixed a thing
Things are looking bad for Santa
Missus Claus has left him and the elves are picketing
Hey! Hey! Ho! Ho! The big fat pig has got to go!
Hey! Hey! Ho! Ho! The big fat pig has got to go!
Santa's had enough he locks the elves outside
He butchers all the reindeer and sells off all their hides
He sells his shop to Disney and leaves the north pole
To go find cheaper labour down in Mexico"

"1831" "Darling for you
I think of what I'd so
To keep you safe and sound
I would climb the highest mountain
I would swim the widest sea
I would wrestle a gorilla to the ground
I would fend off a dozen charging rhinos
I would catch a storm of killer bees
I would fight a firey dragon with a wooden sword
If I didn't know what this could do to me
'Cause it's too dangerous (too dangerous)
I'd really like to do it
But I might get hurt
It's dangerous (too dangerous)
I don't feel like bleeding
On my brand new shirt
You might say I'm cowardly
Or say I'll full of fright
You might call me yellow
And baby you'd be right!
So I'd skip across volcanoes full of lava
I'd even grab a tiger by the tail
I would make fun of
A boxing champion's mother
But my courage and my bowels both would fail
I would fight off a bunch
Of angry Kosacks
I would stop a thousand
Bullets with my hand
I would laugh
As my leg was amputated..
But baby, I'm not that kind of man!
'Cause it's too dangerous (too dangerous)
I use big words
But I never do the deed
It's dangerous (too dangerous)
I faint like a baby
If I see somebody bleed
I haven't got a backbone
I'm as timid as a mouse
I would find a cure for this
But I can't leave the house!
Cause it's dangerous
Too dangerous
Too dangerous
For me!
For me!
For me."
"1832" "Well grab your shoes, and grab your balls

Because Wrestlemania's fine by me
Monster trucks are a sight to see
A cultured life, that's nice and all
But there ain't nothing better than a bowling ball

Is the one with the three-tone leather-sole shoes

Let's go bowling, from a juice can
Let's go bowling
Let's go bowling, let's go bowling
Let's do it now
Yes bowling! The sport of kings! The sport of queens!
The sport of dukes...Earls...Bos...Johns...anything that
Looks good when it's embroidered on a polyester shirt.
And you know, bowling takes on this almost religious
Significance because it's so much like a religion.
I mean the ball is round, like the earth, and it's got
The holy trinity: the Father, the Son, and the..
Thumbhole. And as you roll the ball down the alley of
Life...Striking out the pagan religions of the past...
Sparing them the anguish of their lives in the gutter...
Framing their existence in an eternal metaphysicalness
Something like a 7-10 split!
We'll be bowling in Moosejaw (yeah, yeah)
We'll be bowling in Hickton (yeah, yeah)
We'll be bowling in Gander (yeah, yeah)
And in the Kingston Township (yeah, yeah)
We'll be bowling Vancouver, bowling Saskatoon
Someday they'll even be bowling on the moon
I said yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Yeah, you do, don't you?
You pray to God to give you more hair!
You wake up the next morning, you go in that shower,
you look in that drain...
There's your hair. It ain't on your head no more.
But you know, maybe your call's just not getting through.
God's a busy man, and a lot of people try to get him on
the intergalactic telephone.
But maybe, maybe if we all pray together, we'll get God's
phone to ring! Thank you.

Oh my Lord
Up on your throne
I gotta know
Do you use a comb?
Is your hair wavy?
Is your hair blonde?
Is it curly?

Is to be bald

"1834" "Watchin' television one afternoon
Lookin' for a movie or a good cartoon

Now I watch TV 20 hours a day
Just to watch your commercials play
If someday your love was in reach
I'd be all yours honey, you could put me on a leash
You love that dog, could you love a man?
I make my own gravy when you show that can

You steal my heart, and you take my soul
Every time I see you fill Fido's bowl
I figure the only way she'll notice me
Is if I buy what she's sellin' on TV
So I stop at the local shopping mall
Head to the pet store and buy it all
Go to the bank and empty my savings
So I can buy more of what Spot is craving
Spent all my money by accident
Can't buy groceries or pay the rent
Got evicted now I live on the street
Crunchy kibbles all I got to eat
My breath is real bad, my tongue's turning black
But I've got a nice shiny coat of hair on my back

"1835" "I used to be a farmer and I made a living fine
I had a little stretch of land along the C.P. Line
But times went by, and though I tried, the money wasn't there
And bankers came and took my land, and told me \"fair is fair\".
I looked for every kind of job, the answer always no
\"Hire you now,\" they'd always laugh, \"we just let twenty go!\"
The government, they promised me a measly little sum
But I've got too much pride to end up just another bum
Then I thought, who gives a damn if all the jobs are gone,
I'm gonna be a pirate on the river Saskatchewan.
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores
Well, you'd think the local farmers would know that I'm at large
But just the other day I found an unprotected barge
I snuck up right behind them and they were none the wiser
I rammed their ship and sank it, and I stole their fertilizer.
A bridge outside of Moose Jaw spans a mighty river
Farmers cross in so much fear their stomachs are a-quiver
'Cause they know that Tractor Jack is hidin' in the bay,
I'll jump the bridge and knock 'em cold and sail off with their hay.
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores
Well, Mountie Bob, he chased me, he was always at my throat
He followed on the shoreline, 'cause he didn't own a boat,
But cutbacks were a-coming, so the Mountie lost his job
So now he's sailing with me and we call him Salty Bob.
A swinging sword, a skull-and-bones, and pleasant company,
I never pay my income tax and screw the G.S.T. (Screw it!)
Sailin' down the Saskatoon, the terror of the sea
If you wanna reach the Co-op, boy, you gotta get by me!
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores
Well pirate life's appealing but you don't just find it here
I hear in north Alberta there's a band of buccaneers
They roam the Athabasca from Smith to Fort McKay
And you're gonna lose your Stetson if you have to pass their way
Well, winter is a-coming and a chill is in the breeze
My pirate days are over once the river starts to freeze
I'll be back in springtime, but now I have to go
I hear there's lots of plundering down in New Mexico.
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores
'Cause it's a heave-ho, high-ho, coming down the Plains
Stealing wheat and barley and all the other grains
And it's a ho-hey, high-hey, farmers bar your doors
When you see the Jolly Roger on Regina's mighty shores

"1836" "About 6 months ago, someone came by with a petition
Said we'd wanna stop these folks moving in next door
I refused to sign and told him everyone was welcome
'Cause that's what neighbourhoods are for
So they moved in and I'll admit they look peculiar
They invited me to a friendly barbeque
Glad I got to know 'em, and let me tell you something
They may be metallic, but they're just like me and you
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus
They gave me zucchini from their garden yesterday (they're very fresh)
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus
You may disagree, but I think they're A-OK!
My buddy Charlie never got off the robots' backs
Then one day, him and his whole house disappeared
I talked about it to my neighbours, the killer robots from Venus
They couldn't help me, but agreed that it was wierd...
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus
They always mow their lawn, and they joined the PTA (because we care)
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus
You may disagree, but I think they're A-OK!
They had us over for an outdoor New Year's party
Though it was 10 below, there was food and drink a-plenty
They got excited as we counted down with them
And when we kissed them, our lips stuck to their heads (ouch)
I was watching the news last night, when I saw something funny
Killer robots from somewhere decimated Montreal
I wondered, could it be my neighbours, the killer robots from Venus?
Could it be them after all?
No. They're so nice! Yeah.
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus
They applauded for my kid at the Christmas play (he was the best
shepard)
No, there's nothing wrong with killer robots from Venus
You may disagree, but I think they're A-OK!

"1837" "Our fair country Canada is north of the USA
Our Maritimes are lovely and our prairies give us hay

clean
But we don't have Bob Dole and we can drink when we're
nineteen
We might watch your TV shows for hours and hours and hours
We'll give you Alan Thicke, but Shania Twain is ours

We're proud to be Canadian
We're awfully nice to strangers, our manners be our curse
It's cool in many ways to be Canadian
We won't say that we're better, it's just that we're less worse

Jesus' brotehr Bob, Jesus' brother Bob
A nobody relative of the son of God
If only I'd been born just a little sooner
I'd be more than the brother of God junior
I have to pay the ferry to cross the Galilee
But not my brother, no not him, he walks across for free
I finally get to work 'bout a quarter after nine
Already he's turning water into wine
CHORUS
One day when I was home I heard a mighty roar
There were a thousand people right outside the door
\"Help us Jesus, help us\" came the cheering from the mob
Then they got a look at me, \"Oh nuts, it's only Bob.\"
CHORUS
He died upon the cross, I thought that I was free
Finally people would get to
know me for me
This was my big chance to
finally get ahead
The next thing you know
he's rising from the dead

"1839" "When I joined a band I thought my life was pretty cool
We'd stay in hotels with room service and pools
Sign body parts for fans
Check into rehab and smash up the van
But looking back I should have stayed in school.
Life out on the road can be dangerous you see
Truckstop food and smelly roadies
Are not nearly as scary
As that girl who's at every show
Mouthing the words from the front row
The stalker girl is scaring the hell out of me
She's my creepy stalker girl
I'm the centre of her wacked out crazy and delusional world
She follows me every everywhere
She's even got a bag with some bits of my hair
Just go away you creepy stalker girl
She says I touch her in a very special way
But I'd never go near her now without my pepper spray
And the voices in her head
Said break into my house and sleep in my bed
And they also said that shaving the cat was okay
She's my creepy stalker girl
I'm the centre of her wacked out crazy and delusional world
She follows me every everywhere
She's even got a bag with some bits of my hair
Just go away you creepy stalker girl
I've analysed your handwriting and I've got some bad news
You're manic obsessive with abandonment issues

You're not even cute and your attitude stinks
It must suck to be you
Nobody likes you so what can you do
You think you got problems kid, you think you got strife
But come each December do you fear for your life
I'm your turkey so your troubles are small
I'm stuffed on your table, I'm a tasty butterball
I've got the christmas turkey blues
If you got your necked ripped out then you'd have them too
I've got the christmas turkey blues
You chase me and waste and baste me and taste me and drown me in gravy too
You sir, you look like heck
Didn't you get your Christmas bonus cheque
Or maybe your woman left you
Ripped your heart right out of your chest and spat on it too
Is that why you're wreaking of gin
You look dishevelled and there's drool on your chin
You thought that this love would laugh
But she said Merry Christmas baby and she booted your ass
Well that's tough for you mister, too bad about your ordeal
How about getting stuffed in the wintertime, see how you feel
I don't get to yank no bones or make me a wish
It won't be long til I'm just some scraps on a dish
I've got the christmas turkey blues
If your butt was stuffed and roasted then you'd have then too

I do not go down there to buy my groceries
I respect our farmers and our factories
I don't believe that local means it's poor in quality
It's just our goddamned prices are too high

I get one hundred dollars duty-free

I don't declare the products if they're in my trunk
(He won't declare the products if they're in his trunk)
Although it is Canada that I call home
I don't cheer for the Yankees when I'm in the dome
I didn't swell with pride during the desert storm
It's just that I don't want to pay the tax
(It's just that he's too cheap to pay the tax)
(Yes it's just like this, he's a loyalist)
I'll only shop at malls that fly our flag
(And he'll tell Bob Ray that he just won't pay)
Unless I need my unemployment benefits
(Get a job! Get a job! Get a job!)
Now everybody's doing the same thing as me
They're doing what they can to beat the GST
They're lining up for miles at the duty-free
So I bought a J.C. Penney store in Buffalo
(So everybody come on down to Buffalo)
('Cause if you stay away for just two days)
You'll get one hundred dollars duty free

Well I try to eat a healthy balanced diet
But they all eat their brown beans from the can
They all have to smoke about 6 packs a day
You'd think they was the Marlboro man
And they don't like to go to see the opera
On Friday nights when they get paid
And they don't help me bring in the hanging plants
Every time there's a Native American raid
Oh no, it's true
I'm a sensitive cowboy and I don't know what to do
Oh no, it's kinda strange
I'm the last sensitive cowboy on the range
Cowboy life sure is different these days..
Why brand your cattle when you can just use bovine psychology?
Why have a gunfight when there are so many good paralegals out there?
Nobody drinks in bushwhacks anymore. Besides, we're all switching
over to equal-salt produced tofu jerkey. And if you're gonna ride off
into the sunset, make sure you're using an effective sunblock.
Oh no, it's true
I'm a sensitive cowboy and I don't know what to do

"1845" "A manly song a manly song I like to sing a manly song
My manly friends all sing along as we sing our manly song
I am a manly man who lives a manly life
In my manly house with my manly wife
And two manly children
And a manly guinea pig
My cell phone's very small and my TV's really big.
A manly song a manly song I like to sing a manly song
My manly friends all sing along as we sing our manly song
I was driving like a man when my tire blew off the hub
So I grabbed my cellphone manfully and called the auto club
I stood there like a man until they came along
And as she changed my tire I sang a manly song.
A manly song a manly song I like to sing a manly song
My manly friends all sing along as we sing our manly song
Then we say hey we say hey
it's fun to say hey hey, hey
in a manly way.
How I long for the days when a man was a man
When belching was a sport and chest hair wasn't banned
When we would all get manicures and eat manatee stew
When little's all we did and nothing's all we knew.
A manly song a manly song I like to sing a manly song
My manly friends all sing along
Long, long, long
As we sing our manly song."
"1846" "There was an old farmer who lived on a rock
He sat in the meadow just shaking his
Fist at some boys who were down by the crick
Their feet in the water, their hands on their
Marbles and play things and at half past four
There came a young lady, she looked like a
Pretty young creature, she sat on the grass
She pulled up her dress and she showed them her
Ruffles and laces and a white fluffy duck
She said she was learning a new way to
Bring up her children so they would not spit
While the boys in the barnyard were shoveling
Refuse and litter from yesterday's hunt
While the girl in the meadow was rubbing her
Eyes at the fellow down by the dock
He looked like a man with a sizable
Home in the country, with a big fence out front
If he asked her politely she'd show him her
Little pet dog who was subject to fits
And maybe she'd let him grab hold of her
Small tender hands with a movement so quick
And then she'd bend over and suck on his
Candy so tasty, made of butterscotch
And then he'd spread whipped cream all over her
Cookies that she had left out on her shelf
If you think this is dirty you can go fuck yourself"
"1847" "Our love is like a new car smell

It works for a month then the spark goes missing
Our love is like a barbeque ignition
Our love is like a video game
That you play alot and then it gets lame
Then a new one comes out that's better but the same
Our love is like a video game
Our love..
Our love is like a surgical procedure
It's painful and invasive, your insurance won't cover
And when it's done you walk funny forever
Our love is like a surgical procedure
Our love is like a Meatloaf song
It has its moments but it's way too long
Like a bat outta hell it all goes wrong

We'll talk of burning things
The black urgency of the horses' eyes
Melted in the street
The faint smell of hibiscus
The cracks around your lips
Slowly painted over
In some morning before this
My love, I stood for days
Trying to piece back into place
All the words that fused together
In the fluffy ashen pages
I surrendered every one of them
And the case that couldn't come with them
Just to be with you
To be surrounded by your room
With its outline of a fireplace
Behind the chair, by the fern
Talk with me my darling
We'll lie of burning things
The girl ablaze by the lake
Though I could never have seen it
Your light breeze from the ceiling fan
And traffic hum downstairs
That thing you do with your left foot
At the edge of the carpet squares
My love, I could never sleep
Beneath the blankets nor the sheets
Beyond the new meridian
Scratched into my years
I surrendered every one of them
The long long days, the months of green
Just to be with you
To be surrounded by your room
With its sunlight on an absent mantle
And the hour ending soon
Our hour ending soon"

Neatly in the palm of my hand.

All gather around
The vowels and the nouns
The lights and the noise
All the girls, all the boys

Wound-up to become
Clockwork Monkeys,
Each his own little drum,
With a head full of wishes,
A mouth full of kisses

Things that go fast
Get it real quick
Coz it's never gonna last.
It's a good feel, feel good
Keeping my eyes
One forever forward
And the other behind.

That hand that keeps stirring you
Moving, arousing you
Turning you, wearing you

Wound-up to become
Clockwork Monkeys,
Each his own little drum,
With a head full of wishes,
And a mouth full of kisses
See none, hear none,
Speak none too,
But it's underneath the nails
And it sticks to the shoes.
Sit down, stand up,
Learn to say \"please\",
When you're old enough to perish
Then we'll give you the keys.
Your dreams are beautiful
Your rhythm impeccable
Marching the hollow men
Into the straw
Descended from the apes
Wound-up to become
Clockwork Monkeys,
Clanging on their drums,
With head full of wishes,
Wishes full of heading

Wound-up to become

"1857" "I think the last time that I saw him was
West of the border where the trees are black and
Blue is not the colour of the sky
Hands buried deep in the pockets of his jeans
And his wild hair was powdered with
Our familiar ash
I see his face in every corner
Of each and every rear vision mirror
Of every car I drive
And every face in every corner
Of each and every rear vision mirror
Reminds me of our last night
I think the last time that I saw him was
Out by McCarthy's Road where the pictures on the trees are all faded and torn
Wires in his ears and his shirt of just a year ago
Moving in a circle
Erecting dust around his shoes
I see his face in every corner
Of each and every rear vision mirror of every car I drive
And every face in every corner
Of each and every rear vision mirror
Reminds me of our last night
I think the last time that I saw him was
Down by the tracks and the water tower
With its rusted constellations
Lips dry and every muscle spidering
A place to catch the sun or climb above one
I see his face in every corner
Of each and every rear vision mirror
Of every car I drive
And every face in every corner
Of each and every rear vision mirror reminds me of our last night"

If you don't take my advice.
You get what you can,

far more than you should...
Right now, my happiness only comes from pretending
Because you've already stomped on my pride,

I let you get away with what you did,
I was only being very, very nice.
But you had to take me for someone who's stupid...
You know, I don't like to prove my fights.

Who don't understand how to feel

In the deathcar, we're alive
I'll let some air come in the window
Kind of wakes me up a little
I don't turn on the radio
'Cause they play shit, like
You know
When your hand was down on my dick
It felt quite amazing
And now that, that is all over
All we've got is the silence
In the deathcar, we're alive
In the deathcar, we're alive
So come on mandolins, play
When I touched you
I felt that you still had your baby fat
And a little taste of baby's breath
Makes me forget about death
At your age you're still joking
It ain't time yet for the choking
So now we can see the movie and see each other truly
In the deathcar, we're alive
In the deathcar, we're alive

Along the street or in a small cafe
But still I won't deny you or mistreat you

Since my true love walked out the door
Tears I never had before
Ribbon of darkness over me
Clouds are gatherin' o'er my head
That chill the day and hide the sun
That shroud the night when day is done
Ribbon of darkness over me
Rain is falling on the meadow
Where once my love and I did lie
Now she is gone from the meadow
My love goodbye
Oh how I wish your heart could see
How mine just aches and breaks all day

I can see it in your eyes
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice
Whenever we are talking like this
I can see what you believe in
When his name is mentioned and I die
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk
The way you close your eyes
It's alright for some, but not alright to be
Where the one that I'm lovin' can't be found
The city where we live, might be quite large
But the circle is small, why not tell us all
And then all of us will know?
I can see it in your eyes
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice
Whenever we are talking like this
I can see what you believe in
When his name is mentioned and I die
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk
The way you close your eyes
It's alright to leave, but not alright to lie
When you come home and you can't say where you've been
You think it's fine to do, things I cannot see
And you're doin' it to me, baby, can't you see
That I know how it is?
I can see it in your eyes
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice
Whenever we are talking like this
I can see what you believe in
When his name is mentioned and I die
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk
The way you close your eyes
I can see it in your eyes
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice
Whenever we are talking like this
I can see what you believe in
When his name is mentioned and I die"
"1922" "In the early mornin' rain
With a dollar in my hand
With an aching in my heart
And my pockets full of sand
I'm a long ways from home
And I missed my loved one so
In the early mornin' rain
With no place to go
Out on runway number nine
Big seven o seven set to go
Well I'm stuck here on the grass
Where the pavement never grows
Where the liquor tasted good
And all the women all were fast
There, there she goes my friend
She's rolling down at last
Hear the mighty engines roar
See the silver wing on high
She's away and westward bound
For above the clouds she'll fly
Where the mornin' rain don't fall
And the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home
In about three hours time
This ol' airport's got me down
It's no damn good to me
And I'm stuck here on the ground
As cold and drunk as I can be
Can't jump a jet plane
Like you can a freight train
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin' rain
Can't jump a jet plane
Like you can a freight train
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin' rain"
"1923" "All you need is time
All you need is time, time,
Time to make me bend
Give it a try, don't be rude
Put it to the test and
I'll give it right back to you
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get
A little older every day
Kick it around, take it to town
Try to defy what you feel inside
You better be strong
Your love belongs to us
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get
A little older every day
All I need is trust
All I need is trust, trust,
Trust to make it show
I don't want to know everything you done
If you get a tip then tell it to the eskimos
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get
A little older every day
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get
A little older every day
All we need is faith
All we need is faith, faith,
Faith to make it nice
Kick it around, don't be rude
If you're gonna make a mistake
Don't you make it twice
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get
A little older every day
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get
A little older every day
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get
A little older every day
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get
A little older every day"
"1924" "Upon the bitter green she walked the hills above the town
Echoed to her footsteps as soft as eiderdown
Waiting for her master to kiss away her tears
Waiting through the years
Bitter green they called her walking in the sun
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter green they called her waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone to take her home
Some say he was a sailor who died away at sea
Some say he was a prisoner who never was set free
Lost upon the ocean he died there in the mist
Dreaming of a kiss
Bitter green they called her walking in the sun
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter green they called her waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone to take her home
But now the bitter green is gone the hills have turned to rust
There comes a weary stranger whose tears fall in the dust
Kneeling by the churchyard in the autumn mist
Dreaming of a kiss
Bitter green they called her walking in the sun
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter green they called her waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone to take her home
Bitter green they called her walking in the sun
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter green they called her waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone
To take her home"
"1925" "Pickin' up the pieces of my sweet shattered dream
I wonder how the old folks are tonight
Her name was Ann and I'll be damned if I recall her face
She left me not knowin' what to do
Carefree highway, let me slip away on you
Carefree highway, you seen better days
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away
Slip away on you
Turnin' back the pages to the times I love best
I wonder if she'll ever do the same
Now the thing that I call livin' is just bein' satisfied
With knowin' I got no one left to blame
Carefree highway, got ta see you my old flame
Carefree highway, you seen better days
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away
Slip away on you
Searchin' through the fragments of my dream-shattered sleep
I wonder if the years have closed her mind
I guess it must be wanderlust or tryin' to get free
From the good old faithful feelin' we once knew
Carefree highway, let me slip away on you
Carefree highway, you seen better days
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away
Slip away on you
Let me slip away on you
Carefree highway, got ta see you my old flame
Carefree highway, you seen better days
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away
Slip away on you"
"1926" "Through the woodland, through the valley
Comes a horseman wild and free
Tilting at the windmills passing
Who can the brave young horseman be
He is wild but he is mellow
He is strong but he is weak
He is cruel but he is gentle
He is wise but he is meek
Reaching for his saddlebag
He takes a battered book into his hand
Standing like a prophet bold
He shouts across the ocean to the shore
Till he can shout no more
I have come o'er moor and mountain
Like the hawk upon the wing
I was once a shining knight
Who was the guardian of a king
I have searched the whole world over
Looking for a place to sleep
I have seen the strong survive
And I have seen the lean grown weak
See the children of the earth
Who wake to find the table bare
See the gentry in the country
Riding off to take the air
Reaching for his saddlebag
He takes a rusty sword into his hand
Then striking up a knightly pose
He shouts across the ocean to the shore
Till he can shout no more
See the jailor with his key
Who locks away all trace of sin
See the judge upon the bench
Who tries the case as best he can
See the wise and wicked ones
Who feed upon life's sacred fire
See the soldier with his gun
Who must be dead to be admired
See the man who tips the needle
See the man who buys and sells
See the man who puts the collar
On the ones who dare not tell
See the drunkard in the tavern
Stemming gold to make ends meet
See the youth in ghetto black
Condemned to life upon the street
Reaching for his saddlebag
He takes a tarnished cross into his hand
Then standing like a preacher now
He shouts across the ocean to the shore
Then in a blaze of tangled hooves
He gallops off across the dusty plain
In vain to search again
Where no one will hear
Through the woodland, through the valley
Comes a horseman wild and free
Tilting at the windmills passing
Who can the brave young horseman be
He is wild but he is mellow
He is strong but he is weak
He is cruel but he is gentle
He is wise but he is meek"
"1927" "At times I just don't know
How you could be anything but beautiful
I think that I was made for you
And you were made for me
And I know that I won't ever change
We've been friends through rain or shine
For such a long, long time
Laughing eyes and smiling face
It seems so lucky just to have the right
Of telling you with all my might
You're beautiful tonight
And I know that you won't ever stray
'Cause you've been that way from day to day
For such a long, long time
And when you hold me tight
How could life be anything but beautiful
I think that I was made for you
And you were made for me
And I know that I won't ever change
We've been friends through rain or shine
For such a long, long time
Well, I must say it means so much to me
To be the one who's telling you
I'm telling you, that you're beautiful"
"1928" "There's a house on a hill
By a worn down weathered old mill
In the valley below where the river winds
There's no such thing as bad times
And a soft southern flame
Oh Cotton Jenny's her name
She wakes me up when the sun goes down
And the wheels of love go 'round
Wheels of love go 'round
Love go 'round, love go 'round
A joyful sound
I ain't got a penny for Cotton Jenny to spend
But then the wheels go 'round
When the new day begins
I go down to the cotton gin
And I make my time worth while to them
Then I climb back up again
And she waits by the door
Oh Cotton Jenny I'm sore
And she rubs my feet while the sun goes down
And the wheels of love go 'round
Wheels of love go 'round
Love go 'round, love go 'round
A joyful sound
I ain't got a penny for Cotton Jenny to spend
But then the wheels go 'round
In the hot, sickly south
When they say we'll shut my mouth
I can never be free from the cotton grind
But I know I got what's mine
With a soft southern flame
Oh Cotton Jenny's her name
She wakes me up when the sun goes down
And the wheels of love go 'round"
"1929" "That's what you get for lovin' me
That's what you get for lovin' me
Every thing you had is gone as you can see
That's what you get for lovin' me
I ain't the kind to hang around
With any new love that I found
Since movin' is my stock in trade, I'm movin' on
I won't think of you when I'm gone
So don't you shed a tear for me
Because I ain't the love you thought I'd be
I got a hundred more like you, so don't be blue
I'll have a thousand 'fore I'm through
That's what you get for lovin' me
That's what you get for lovin' me
Every thing you had is gone as you can see
That's what you get for lovin' me
It's so nice to meet an old friend and pass the time of day
And talk about the home town a million miles away
Is the ice still on the river, are the old folks still the same
And by the way, did she mention my name?
Did she mention my name just in passing
And when the morning came
Do you remember if she dropped a name or two?
Is the home team still on fire, do they still win all the games
And by the way, did she mention my name?
Did she mention my name just in passing
And when the talk ran high
Did the look in her eye seem far away?
Won't you say hello from someone, they'll be no need to explain
And by the way, did she mention my name?"
"1930" "There was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run
When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun
Long before the white man and long before the wheel
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real
But time has no beginnings and hist'ry has no bounds
As to this verdant country they came from all around
They sailed upon her waterways and they walked the forests tall
Built the mines the mills and the factories for the good of us all
And when the young man's fancy was turnin' to the spring
The railroad men grew restless for to hear the hammers ring
Their minds were overflowing with the visions of their day
And many a fortune lost and won and many a debt to pay
For they looked in the future and what did they see
They saw an iron road runnin' from sea to the sea
Bringin' the goods to a young growin' land
All up through the seaports and into their hands
Look away said they across this mighty land
From the eastern shore to the western strand
Bring in the workers and bring up the rails
We gotta lay down the tracks and tear up the trails
Open 'er heart let the life blood flow
Gotta get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow
Bring in the workers and bring up the rails
We're gonna lay down the tracks and tear up the trails
Open 'er heart let the life blood flow
Gotta get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow
Get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow
Behind the blue Rockies the sun is declinin'
The stars, they come stealin' at the close of the day
Across the wide prairie our loved ones lie sleeping
Beyond the dark oceans in a place far away
We are the navvies who work upon the railway
Swingin' our hammers in the bright blazin' sun
Livin' on stew and drinkin' bad whiskey
Bendin' our old backs 'til the long days are done
We are the navvies who work upon the railway
Swingin' our hammers in the bright blazin' sun
Layin' down track and buildin' the bridges
Bendin' our old backs 'til the railroad is done
So over the mountains and over the plains
Into the muskeg and into the rain
Up the St. Lawrence all the way to Gaspe
Swingin' our hammers and drawin' our pay
Drivin' 'em in and tyin' 'em down
Away to the bunkhouse and into the town
A dollar a day and a place for my head
A drink to the livin' and a toast to the dead
Oh the song of the future has been sung
All the battles have been won
O'er the mountain tops we stand
All the world at our command
We have opened up the soil
With our teardrops and our toil
For there was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run
When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun
Long before the white man and long before the wheel
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real
And many are the dead men too silent to be real"
"1931" "Rows of lights in a circle of steel
Where you place your bets on a great big wheel
High windows flickerin' down through the snow
A time you know
Sights and sounds of the people goin' 'round
Everybody's in step with the season
A child is born to a welfare case
Where the rats run around like they own the place
The room is chilly, the building is old
That's how it goes
The doctor's found on his welfare round
And he comes and he leaves on the double
Deck The Halls was the song they played
In the flat next door where they shout all day
She tips her gin bottle back till it's gone
The child is strong
A week, a day, they will take it away
For they know about all her bad habits
Christmas dawns and the snow lets up
And the sun hits the handle of her heirloom cup
She hides her face in her hands for a while
Says look here child
Your father's pride was his means to provide
And he's servin' three years for that reason"
"1932" "Dee dee dee, dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee
I would rather be at the boathouse, out of the daily grind
I'd sooner be down at the boathouse, what a way to unwind
Now I don't wanna know how it feels to be set back
So I'm leavin' here on a one-way track
I'd rather be in mosquito alley, out of my right hand lane
You'd rather see my mosquiot tally, all that moves is fair game
Now I don't wanna know how it feels not to be loose
So I'm leavin' here on the first caboose
I'm leavin' here on the first caboose
I can't sleep by a gentle ocean and I can't sleep my a water fall
I can't sleep by a lovely river, I can't sleep and I can't sleep
Dee dee dee, dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee
I would rather sleep at the boathouse, what more can I say
I'd soon eat down at the boathouse, let it carry me away
Now I don't wanna know how it feels to step aside
So I'm leavin' here on a wicked ride
Or I could be back at the alehouse, with a flagon or two
A few blocks south of the jail house, with a hole in my shoe
Now, I don't wanna know how it feels to stop a truck
So I'm leavin' here and wishin' you good luck
I'm leavin' here and wishin' you good luck
I can't sleep by a deep ocean, I can't sleep by a water fall
I can't sleep by a lovely river, I can't sleep and I can't sleep

"1933" "I don't believe in miracles if it's all the same by you
Your wishes would come true if I had my say
Whether it's right or wrong, the words of every song
Remind us of a love we knew
Where love should not go wrong, in yesterdays
Hang on ye drifters now
You got so much to go and gamble on
Watch out for the shifting sand
Where ever you may ramble
Even now, as I look back and see all that's come to pass
I can't remember how it was I got here
Look around this place, there's a smile on every face
We're somewhere in the afterglow, out there among the stars
Out there among the bars
Hang on ye drifters now
You got places to go and people to meet
Watch out for the shifting tide
Where ever you may travel
I know I should not complain because life's been good to me
It feels real good to be stranded on my own
Be that as it may be, we are what we are
I'll find you in the afterglow out there among the stars
Of yesteryear
Hang on ye drifters now
You got so much to go and gamble on
Watch out for the shifting sand
Where ever you may ramble
All you drifters now
You got places to go and people to meet
Watch out for the shifting tide
Where ever you may travel"
"1934" "I was sittin' in my hotel room, strummin' my old guitar
Not much to do when you're far away, playin' some smokey bar
I was feelin' a little empty and feelin' a little blue
When the maid came in and asked me if she could do my room
I put down my old guitar and she gave me a smile
She had a crusty voice and a drinker's look, but she had a friendly style
She dusted my room and made my bed and she talked of days gone by
She spoke of when she wooed the men; a tear came to her eye
And she said
I used to be a country singer
I could sing a mean patsy cline
My husband he could yodel like wilf carter
Kitty wells was a real good friend of mine
She told me that her husband died and her son was overseas
I could tell by her eyes and her broken smile she was lonely just like me
She asked me if I'd listen to a tape of when she was young
She said I can't sing now I forgot the words and my voice is almost gone
And she said
I used to be a country singer
I could sing a mean patsy cline
My husband he could yodel like wilf carter
Kitty wells was a real good friend of mine
Oh I cried inside but I couldn't tell if it was for her or for me
So I grabbed my axe and we sang a song in two part harmony
Ever since that day when I'm feelin' down and I can't find a happy tune
I just think if that maid and the feeling she gave, when she came to clean my room
And she said
I used to be a country singer
I could sing a mean patsy cline
My husband he could yodel like wilf carter
Kitty wells was a real good friend of mine
And she said
I used to be a country singer
I could sing a mean patsy cline
My husband he could yodel like wilf carter
Kitty wells was a real good friend of mine

"1935" "Once upon a time I was on my own
Once upon a time like you've never known
Once upon a time I would be impressed
Once upon a time my life would be obsessed
Once upon a time, once upon a day

If you want to know my secret don't come runnin' after me
For I am just a painter passing through in history
Yesterday is gone, yesterday's alright
Yesterday belongs in my dreams at night
Yesterday is swell, yesterday is great
Yesterday is strong, remembering can wait
Once upon a time, once upon a day
When I was in my prime, once along the way
If you want to know an answer I can't turn your life around
For I am just a painter passing through the underground
I was in my stride, always at my game
Here comes mister cool along the walk of fame
I was in demand, always in control
The world was in my hands, my touch had turn to gold
Once upon a time, I was in a daze
When I was in my prime, once along the way
If you want to know my secret don't come runnin after me
For I am just a painter passing through in history
Now that I am old, let me rest a spell
All that I am told, I can never tell
Never in my life, never will it pass
I am still alone, remembering at last
Once upon a time, once upon a day
When I was in my prime, once along the way
If you want to know an answer I can't turn your life around
For I am just a painter passing through the underground
If you want to know my secret don't come runnin after me

You're like time is to space
You're like faith is to trustin'
You're like blue is to feelin' unkind
You're like joy is for love,
You're like dreams are for chasin'
You're as fine as fine can be
And when I am gone my thoughts are all with you
You're my little angel you see
You're as bright as the moon
You're as light as a feather
You're as fine as fine can be
Like the rain is for the crops
You're like food for my thoughts
You're like true is for knowin' what's not

You're like bees are for buzzin'
You're as fine as fine can be"

The moon shines on my window sill
I've got a feeling I might walk on over the hill
I'm bent but not broken, all I need is some rest
And a bottle of your very best
Blackberry wine
There's a new moon risin' and
The wind sings its old song
Pass it on over it's a sin to be sober too long
I'm bent but not broken, all I need is my share
Of a bottle of that very rare
Blackberry wine
My old gal's got a new dress on five and dime
Try as she will she can't get me
To come home on time
But I'd never cheat her
Or mistreat her you know
As over the mountain I go
Blackberry wine
I'll be soft spoken
All I need is my rest
And a bottle of your very best
Blackberry wine
Now my days are numbered
And one more heel's been killed
Blackberry John left me
His old recipe in his will
I'm bent but not broken,
All I need is some time
And a bottle of your very fine
Blackberry wine
Blackberry wine,
You know that I'm quite dry without you
Blackberry wine"

"1939" "I'm sailing down the summer wind
I got whiskers on my chin
And I like the mood I'm in
As I while away the time of day
In the lee of Christian Island
Tall and strong she dips and reels
I call her Silver Heels
And she tells me how she feels
She's a good old boat and she'll stay afloat
Through the toughest gales and keep smiling
But for one more day she would like to stay
In the lee of Christian Island
I'm sailing down the summer day
Where fish and seagulls play
I put my troubles all away
And when the gale comes up I'll fill my cup
With the whiskey of the highlands
She's a good old ship and she'll make the trip
From the lee of Christian Island
Tall and strong she slips along
I sing for her a song
And she leans into the wind
She's a good old boat and she'll stay afloat
Through the toughest gales and keep smilin'
When the summer ends we will rest again
In the lee of Christian Island"
"1940" "Now it looks to me like the same old place
In the sky it looks like rain
The same old town with the same old streets
The address has not change
You can find me there
With the door shut tight
And the one wish that remains
Baby step back baby step back
Either step up or step back
No you know I don't write no bad checks
I have no wish to repent
I've seen a few
But whatever I do
I don't cause no accidents
Whiskey and wine help me pass the time
I don't leave no evidence
Baby step back baby step back
Either step up or step back
Baby step back baby step back
Either step up or step back
Still I don't kneel down
I was born to fight
So you'd best leave me alone
Maybe I'll get much more than I need
Or much less than I should own
Last of all let me say it again
Either step up or step on
Baby step back baby step back
Either step up or step back
Baby step back baby step back
Either step up or step back
Baby walk back baby walk back
Either step up or step back
Baby walk back
Baby walk back
Either walk on or walk back
Baby step back baby step back
Either step up or step back
Baby step back baby step back
Either step up or step back"
"1941" "Oh the neon lights were flashin'
And the icy wind did blow
The water seeped into his shoes
And the drizzle turned to snow
His eyes were red, his hopes were dead
And the wine was runnin' low
And the old man came home
From the forest
His tears fell on the sidewalk
As he stumbled in the street
A dozen faces stopped to stare
But no one stopped to speak
For his castle was a hallway
And the bottle was his friend
And the old man stumbled in
From the forest
Up a dark and dingy staircase
The old man made his way
His ragged coat around him
As upon his cot he lay
And he wondered how it happened
That he ended up this way
Getting lost like a fool
In the forest
And as he lay there sleeping
A vision did appear
Upon his mantle shining
A face of one so dear
Who had loved him in the springtime
Of a long-forgotten year
When the wildflowers did bloom
In the forest
She touched his grizzled fingers
And she called him by his name
And then he heard the joyful sound
Of children at their games
In an old house on a hillside
In some forgotten town
Where the river runs down
From the forest
With a mighty roar the big jets soar
Above the canyon streets
And the con men con but life goes on
For the city never sleeps
And to an old forgotten soldier
The dawn will come no more
For the old man has come home
From the forest"
"1942" "Hey you upon this ship of fools
I have found you bending your own rules
Thank you I don't mind if I do
Dream a while of the lovin' that we knew
There was such a flaming time
I never will forget
It was all so easy then
This is my one regret
Hey you my angel in blue
Mother Nature saved her best for you
Green grow the lilacs on the wall
Heaven help them, catch them as they fall
Hey you angel in disguise
What is your angle what is your surprise
Hey you fever that is mine
What is your game plan what is your design
Reality brings mystery
And ne'er the twain shall meet
And all of my wild horses
Cannot pull you off your feet
Hey you angel on my mind
All around me til the end of time
Thank you I don't mind if I do
Dream a while of the lovin' that we knew
There was such a flaming time
I never will forget
It was all so easy then
This is my one regret
Hey you my angel in blue
I'm entangled tell me what to do
Green grow the lilacs on the wall
Heaven help them catch them as they fall"
"1943" "Boss Man, Boss Man what do ya say
I gotta get you alone in the mine some day
Boss Man, Boss Man turn it around
If you don't look away how can I sit down
Look at this load upon my back
Gotta get this wheel back on the track
I can't hold on but I can't let go
And I can't say yes I can't say 'no'
Holes in my pockets and holes in my shoes
If you're ready for me I'm ready for you
The company plan takes all my pay
Got a child in July and another last May
Boss Man, Boss Man what do ya say
Gonna get you alone in the mine some day
Push your face down in the coal
'Cause you got no heart you got no soul
Country life's the life for me
In ten more years I'll a pensioner be
The younger lad knows when the girls are out
But you might say he's a rural sprout
Boss Man, Boss Man what do ya say
Gonna get you alone in the mine some day
Boss Man, Boss Man clear the track
You're gonna tear the skin right offa my back
Boss Man, Boss Man what do ya say
If you can't lend a hand then get outta my way
It'll be murder in the first degree
If you ever lay your hands on me
Boss Man, Boss Man pay my rent
A dollar I've earned is a dollar I've spent
The company plan takes all my check
For breakin' my back and riskin' my neck
Boss Man, Boss Man what do ya say
I gotta get you alone in the mine some day
I can't hold on but I can't let go
And I can't say yes I can't say 'no"
"1944" "I'll be alright I'll be alright if I don't have to smile
If I don't to face the morning sunrise for a while
I'll get along you know I'll take tomorrow with a grin
If I never have to think about her love again
And I won't mind if words are spoken
In empty love songs as long as I don't have to hear
I'll be alright if I don't have to face the world again
And if I never love again I'll be alright
Last night she gave the final word, she said her last goodbye
And disappeared forever in the world outside
One kiss and then she took her leave to go I know not where
Into the misty shadows of the midnight air
But I won't mind if words are spoken
In empty love songs as long as I don't have to hear
I'll be alright if I don't have to face the world again
And if I never love again I'll be alright
And if I never love again I'll be alright"
"1945" "If I could sing like the poets and kings of this world
If I could rise like the wind or the tides of the sea
I would sing you to sleep my love with sweet melody
And let you dream away till the morning light returned again
To take you away from me
If I could speak with the tongues of the masters of old
If I could tame all the fleeting perceptions I hold
Would I stand in the marketplace before
To be shouted down without any warning at all, to be stood by the wall
And shot by the man in blue
If I could run with the grace of a sun-colored stallion
If I could fly like the great silver jets in the morning
If I caused the wind to change with one wave of my hand
And if I could play the final symphony and set it free
Would it mean anything to you
If I could stand like a rusty old man in his armor
If I could ride the steed that he rode in his time
I would turn his head away to the river
And let him wander through the meadow grass, wild and free
For everyone to see"
"1946" "A one man band on a one night stand
As a one man band should be
The cried for more, he replied why sure
And he played one just for free
The sounds he laid down. the songs he played
Made the ladies all come to call
He was born in the back of a Seminole bus
On the road to Niagara Falls
I'd do it again, I'd do it again
I'd do it again
The one man band philosophical man
Didn't lie when he said to us
I seen the high rollers come and go
It's the holy rollers I trust
The man said then he was sixteen when
He retired from the county school
A wee bit thin with a will to begin
He was known to be know man's fool
I'd do it again, I'd do it again
I'd do it again
The one man band was a mighty good man
Cause he played 'til the break of dawn
He ups and downs about four more rounds
And he stayed 'til the crowd went home
It seemed to me like he never could be
Like anything I'd ever seen before
When he stepped from the stage
With his ax in his hand
And he run through the backstage door
I'd do it again, I'd do it again
I'd do it again
A one man band on a one night stand
As a one man band should be
They cried for more, he replied why sure
And he played one just for free"
"1947" "You come to me in times of need
When you can't find anyone
You seem to be much better off now
There's a rainbow number one
We could see life through the gutter then
Till it caused my heart to break
There was too much toil in dreamland
And too much love to take
Sometimes I remember when
We were all dressed up in still
I don't recall the gist of it all
But you drove the young men wild
You could wrap me around your finger
Till it caused my heart to break
There was too much toil in dreamland
And too much love to take
So if you need me near you
You can do it if you choose
There was too much toil in dreamland
And too much love to lose
You make me do what you want me to do
Then you run the rules on me
You seem to be the wiser now
Could it be you'be been deceived
Anytime you felt like tryin'
You would cause my heart to break
There was too much toil in dreamland
And too much love to take"
"1948" "Black day in July
Motor city madness has touched the countryside
And through the smoke and cinders
You can hear it far and wide
The doors are quickly bolted
And the children locked inside
Black day in July
Black day in July
And the soul of Motor City is bared across the land
As the book of law and order is taken in the hands
Of the sons of the fathers who were carried to this land
Black day in July
Black day in July
In the streets of Motor City is a deadly silent sound
And the body of a dead youth lies stretched upon the ground
Upon the filthy pavement
No reason can be found
Black day in July
Black day in July
Motor City madness has touched the countryside
And the people rise in anger
And the streets begin to fill
And there's gunfire from the rooftops
And the blood begins to spill
Black day in July
In the mansion of the governor
There's nothing that is known for sure
The telephone is ringing
And the pendulum is swinging
And they wonder how it happened
And they really know the reason
And it wasn't just the temperature
And it wasn't just the season
Black day in July
Black day in July
Motor City's burning and the flames are running wild
They reflect upon the waters of the river and the lake
And everyone is listening
And everyone's awake
Black day in July
Black day in July
The printing press is turning
And the news is quickly flashed
And you read your morning paper
And you sip your cup of tea
And you wonder just in passing
Is it him or is it me
Black day in July
In the office of the President
The deed is done the troops are sent
There's really not much choice you see
It looks to us like anarchy
And then the tanks go rolling in
To patch things up as best they can
There is no time to hesitate
The speech is made the dues can wait
Black day in July
Black day in July
The streets of Motor City now are quiet and serene
But the shapes of gutted buildings
Strike terror to the heart
And you say how did it happen
And you say how did it start
Why can't we all be brothers
Why can't we live in peace
But the hands of the have-nots
Keep falling out of reach
Black day in July
Black day in July
Motor city madness has touched the countryside
And through the smoke and cinders
You can hear it far and wide
The doors are quickly bolted
And the children locked inside"
"1949" "I go in for singing,
I do it for my pay
But the kind of gig
I can really dig
Is swiggin' at the break of day
With a few good friends and neighbors
Into playin' the nighttime tunes
So pass the jar and that old guitar
In this hangdog hotel room
I believe in magic,
A little monkeyshines
But the kind of row I can really hoe
Is playin' in tune on time
With rhythms all around us
We're like weavers at the loom
So pass the jar and that old guitar
In this hangdog hotel room
Oh Lord it feels so good
To play a nighttime tune
So pass the jar and that old guitar
In this hangdog hotel room
When it comes to mornin'
And goin' out at night
Well the kind of test that I like the best
Is rubbin' the wrong girl right
And a few good friends and neighbors
In to playin' the nighttime tunes
So pass the jar and that old guitar
In this hangdog hotel room"
"1950" "All around old Cape Horn
Ships of the line, ships of the morn
Some who wish they'd never been born
They are the ghosts of Cape Horn
Fal deral da riddle de rum
With a rim dim diddy
And a rum dumb dumb
Sailing away at the break of dawn
They are the ghosts of Cape Horn
See them all in sad repair
Demons dance everywhere
Southern gales, tattered sails
And none to tell the tales
Come all of you rustic old sea dogs
Who follow the great Southern Cross
You we're rounding the Horn
In the eye of a storm
When ya lost 'er one day
And you read all yer letters
From oceans away
Then you took them to the bottom of the sea
All around old Cape Horn

Sailing away at the break of dawn

Southampton, Penzance, and Kinsale

Of a sailor's last dance
It was not meant to be

"1951" "Well, it's four o'clock in the afternoon
And the anchors have been weighed
From Miami to Nassau
She's bound across the waves
She'll be headin' south through Biscayne Bay
Into the open sea
Yarmouth Castle, she's a-dyin' and don't know it
Now the many years she's been to sea
She's seen the better times
She gives a groan of protest
As they cast away her lines
And the grumble of her engines
And the rust along her spine
Tells the Castle she's too old to be sailin'
But the sands run out within her heart
A tiny spark glows red
It smolders through the evening
There's laughter overhead
Now the dinner's served and the cards are dealt
And the drinks are passed around
Deep within the fire starts a-burnin'
Now it's midnight on the open sea
And the moon is shinin' bright
Some people join the party
And others say goodnight
There's many who are sleepin' now
It's been a busy day
And a tiny wisp of smoke is a-risin'
\"Oh Lord,\" she groans, \"I'm burning
Let someone understand\"
But her silent plea is wasted
In the playin' of the band
Everybody's dancin' on her deck
And they're havin' such a time
And a voice says, \"Shut up and deal, I'm losin'\"
Deep within the Yarmouth Castle
The fire begins to glow
It leaps into the hallways
And climbs and twists and grows
And the paint she wore to keep her young
Oh Lord, how well it burns
And soon that old fire is a-ragin'
Up beneath the bridge it's climbin' fast
The captain stands aloft
He calls up to the boatswain, says
\"Boatswain, we are lost\"
For the ragged hoses in the racks
No pressure do they hold
And the people down below will soon be dyin'
All amidships, oh she's blazin' now
It's spreadin' fore and aft
The people are a-scramblin'
As the fire blocks their path
The evil smoke surrounds them
And they're fallin' in their tracks
And the captain in his lifeboat is a-leavin'
Oh then the ship, Bahama Star
Comes steamin' through the night
She sees the Castle blazin'
And 'tis a terrible sight
\"Jump down, jump down\", the captain cries
\"We'll save you if we can\"
Then the paint on his funnels is a-fryin'
\"God help the ones who sleep below
And cannot find the way
Thank God for those we rescue
Upon this awful day\"
Now the heroes, they are many
But the times are growin' slim
And now from stern to bow, she's a-blazin'
Oh the Yarmouth Castle's moanin'
She's cryin' like a child
You can hear her if you listen
Above the roar so wild
Is she cryin' for the ones who lie
Within her molten sides?
Or cryin' for herself, I'm a-wonderin'
But the livin' soon were rescued
The ones who lived to tell
From the Star they watched her
As she died there in the swells
Like a toy ship on a mill pond
She burned all through the night
Then slipped beneath the waves in the mornin'"
"1952" "In the early mornin' rain
With a dollar in my hand
With an aching in my heart
And my pockets full of sand
I'm a long ways from home
And I missed my loved one so
In the early mornin' rain
With no place to go
Out on runway number nine
Big seven o seven set to go
Well I'm stuck here on the grass
Where the pavement never grows
Where the liquor tasted good
And all the women all were fast
There, there she goes my friend
She's rolling down at last
Hear the mighty engines roar
See the silver wing on high
She's away and westward bound
For above the clouds she'll fly
Where the mornin' rain don't fall
And the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home
In about three hours time
This ol' airport's got me down
It's no damn good to me
And I'm stuck here on the ground
As cold and drunk as I can be
Can't jump a jet plane
Like you can a freight train
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin' rain
Can't jump a jet plane
Like you can a freight train
So I best be on my way
In the early mornin' rain"
"1953" "In this land of chance do we know right from wrong
Even at a glance we know the road is long
We don't owe a single thing to anyone
Most of us do not believe in come what may
Everything we fought for was in vain they say
Even when called upon to throw our lives away
We have been captured by the thieves of the night
Held for ransom if you please
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasnt memories
In these times of trial and uncertainty
I have thought what does this freedom mean to me
Is it just some long forgotten fantasy
Our love for each other may not be explained
We live in a world where tears must fall like rain
Most of us don't wish to cause each other pain
We have been captured by the thieves of the night
Held for ransom if you please
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasnt memories
To every unsung hero in the universe
To those who roam the skies and those who roam the earth
To all good men of reason may they never thirst
We have wings to guide us through the timeless sea
And faith that will remain through all eternity
We try to be helpful to the ones in need
We have been captured by the thieves of the night
Held for ransom if you please
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasant memories"
"1954" "All I can see is the sea and the sky
And the sky is blue and the sea is green
Yesterday's a cabaret
Gowns of satin on ladies gay
Yesterday's a cabaret
Sounds of laughter on faces gray
Yesterday's a carousel
Catch the ring and all will be well
From the coast of California
Up to the Oregon border
I've thumbed a thousand miles I guess
Sitting in a roadside diner
The big trucks rollin' by
I don't seem to know at times what's best
And still I'd like to tell her
That I miss her so, in north Ontario
If you're drivin' east to Reno
Or north to Mendocino
I hope you find your rainbow?s end
This highway is my rainbow
And though I might regret it
I'm so glad I said it way back when
And still I'd like to tell her
That I miss her so, in north Ontario"
"1955" "When I walk the hill so high
Around the town where I was born
New York seems so far away
Though I was there just yesterday
I have played on my guitar
In coffeehouses, hall and bars
Everyone that I call friend
Knows they will not be forgot
Trains and planes and rented cars
Singers, saints and other starts
I suspect them every one
They'll never change, it's too much fun
Just for now I'd like to rest
In the shade of a maple tree
To the blue Canadian sky
I'll say a prayer for the world out there
When I stand on my own sod
It feels so good to be home, by God
The winter wind has turned my head
But I always came up warm somehow
Bottles, beads and cigarettes
And lovers that I ain't found yet
Pickin' with a friend till dawn
And singing all of those hi'way songs
Just for now I'd like to rest
In the shade of a maple tree
To the blue Canadian sky
I'll say a prayer for the world out there
When I walk the hill so high
Around the town where I was born
New York seems so far away
Though I was there just yesterday
I would travel all my life
If loneliness was not the price
While headin' north across that line's
The only time I'm flyin'"
"1956" "Oh, when he was a man, my father would stand
I never saw him run
There wasn't anyone could make the man bend
The strength of his will was the tool of his trade
And he did his work well
Till the powers that be took a liking to him
And they traded his body for a cold empty shell
Don't beat me down
Don't beat me down
I've got something to say
Don't you stand in my way
And don't beat me down
Oh, when I was a youth, I found the truth
In the eyes of a friend
There wasn't anyone could make the light dim
And we talked and we rambled and we gambled to win
And the learning was good
Till the powers that be to a liking to him
They traded their fortunes for the sight of his blood
When I was a child and my mother smiled
At the cradle she bought
For the little tot she held to her breast
And the song that she sang was an anthem to love
It was all that I heard
Till the powers that be took a liking to me
And they told me that love was a four-letter word
Don't beat me down
Don't beat me down
I've got one life to live
And that's all I can give
So don't beat me down
And now I've got a place, I got a worried face
And a question in mind
Please let me find a reason somehow
Why some reap the harvest while other men die
And the joker runs wild
And if powers that be take a liking to us
Then we all must return to the ways of a child
We all must return to the ways of a child
So don't beat me down
Don't beat me down
I've got something to say
Don't you stand in my way
And don't beat me down
I've got one life to life
And that's all I can give
So don't beat me down
Don't beat me down
Don't beat me down"
"1957" "I see a place where candles burn and lovers rest tonight
The hollow sound inside me now keeps telling me to write
But songs of love will never leave love's feelings undefiled
The tide has turned, the waves roll in, the waters fill my eyes
The price of lust has risen till the ceiling will not stand
The tears I shed were not in shame, the world was in my hands
If trust was just a simple thing then trusting I would be
But deep within my soul I know it's better to be free
The days fly by, the waves roll in, but freedom has not come
I fear my faith will soon give out, my senses come undone
My role is played, the demon dogs come stealin' o'er land
And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand
I see a place where candles burn and lovers rest tonight
The hollow sound inside me now keeps telling me to write
But songs of love should not be sung where staying is not planned
And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand
And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand"

"1959" "Where did ya go when the snow lay on the ground
What did ya do when the rain began to fall
How did it feel when I looked through your soul
When was the last time you wanted my love
How many nights did you cry your dreams to sleep
Why did you hide what you knew would not stay hidden
How could you put yourself through like you did
I'm not the kind that would hold you that way
Drop me a line if ya wake up feelin' bad
I'm still a friend and I'd like to hear from you
Where does it say love should last forever
When was the last time I told that to you
Farewell to annabel, farewell
Farewell to annabel, farewell
Farewell to annabel, fare thee well
Farewell to annabel, farewell"
"1960" "I came down through Albany to New York
To find what I'd been missin'
I looked across the river to the city
Where the windows all stood glistenin'
I stood listenin'
Into a tunnel I did rise, like a grave inside
But I was young and able
When I came out the other end
Ah through the smoke, the winter light was feeble
Unreadable
I was optimistic though, a cabbie told me where to go
I thanked him
A face of white, a face of brown
Ah here a smile and there a look of danger
For a stranger
It was too unreal for me
I found no one who trusted me
There was no man could offer me
A cold hand from New York
Cold hands from New York
A voice within you cries, \"Won't someone please help me
I'll do the same for you one day
If you should ever pass my way and need me\"
I came down to live alone in New York
The city of the living
There were fortunes at my feet but most of men
Were taking, none we giving
Or forgiving
Children ran and children played and roses grew in alleyways
I saw them
There were men who lived in style and others who had died
Where no one knew them
Beause they couldn't win
There were parks where old men slept and dingy rooms
Where babies crept unwanted
Till I began to ask myself if there were hope
Or if it mattered what they did
Or if they lived
It was too unreal for me
I found no one who trusted me
There was no man could offer me
A cold hand from New York
Cold hands from New York
A voice within you cries, \"Won't someone please help me
I'll do the same for you one day
If you should ever pass my way and need me\"
I came down through Albany to New York
To find what I'd been missin'
I looked across the river to the city
Where the windows all stood glistenin'
I stood listenin'
And there were prophets in the squares
And people there who smiled and said, \"Forget it\"
There were lovers in the park
And there was danger in the dark, I felt it
So afraid of it
And there were preachers of the Word and poets
Who were never heard, I heard them
There were those who would not try to learn
The measure of the lie they're livin'
I heard a young musician play in a place
Where they paid you not to listen
I heard a woman scream for help while men stood by
And offered their best wishes
That's how it is
It was too unreal for me
I found no one who trusted me
There was no man could offer me
A cold hand from New York
Cold hands from New York
A voice within you cries, \"Won't someone please help me
I'll do the same for you one day
If you should ever pass my way and need me\"

On the down side of town
But it lingered on long after she'd gone
I remember it well

And we came through a doorway somewhere in the night
Her long flowing hair came softly undone
And it lay all around
And she brushed it down as I stood by her side
In the warmth of her love
And she showed me her treasures of paper and tin
And we played a game only she could win
And she told me a riddle I'll never forget
Then left with the answer I've never found yet
\"How long\", said she, \"Can a moment like this
Belong to someone?\"
\"What's wrong, what is right, when to live or to die
We must almost be born\"
So if you should ask me what secrets I hide
I'm only your lover, don't make me decide
The perfume that she wore was from some little store
On the down side of town
But it lingered on long after she'd gone
I remember it well
And she showed me her treasures of paper and tin
And we played a game only she could win
And our fingers entwined like ribbons of light
And we came through a doorway somewhere in the night"
"1964" "Any way the wind may blow
Any way the creek may flow
Any way the crow may fly
Within the confines of the sky
I will prove my love to you
In everything I say and in all I do
Anywhere the song is king
Anywhere the robin sings
Anywhere the lake is cold
Anywhere the bell is tolled
I will prove my love to you
In everything I say and in all I do
Anytime our paths don't cross
And the losin' dice are tossed
Anytime you know what's best
Anytime I can't care less
I'll make it up to you
In everything I say and in all I do
Any way the wind may blow
Any way I stub my toe
Any way the tree might bend
Any way the day might end
I will prove my love to you
In everything I say and in all I do
I will make it up to you
In everything I say and in all I do"
"1965" "I'm on my way, got no time to waste
Places to go, people to chase
Gonna grab my comb 'n' my toothpaste
Gotta get away from here
Twenty-one years from the day I was born
I was workin' on the night shift, tootin' my horn
Through sheets of rain, through sleet and storm
You come to me
You were the girls with the summer sunshine
In your eyes and in your smile
You were the one I thought, I thought loved me
It was somethin' I never could quite believe
Gotta get away from here
I'm a real bad loser, that's what I am
Gonna grab my hat and my hexagram
You can stick my money in an old tin can
I think I fell in love again
I was down by the bus stop, bidin' my time
I was hitchin' a ride with a friend of mine
I was almost gone, I was over the line
I said what's come over me
You were the girl with the sound of springtime
In your songs and in your voice
You were the one I thought, loved me
It was somethin' I never could quite believe
Gotta get away from here, gotta get back to you
I'm gonna make it today, I'm gonna get on my toes
Been awake so long, I'm getting ready to doze
Gonna grab my bag and a few old clothes
Gotta get away from here, gotta get back to you
Gotta get away, gotta get away, gotta get away
Gotta get away, gotta get away"
"1966" "Born in the country and I like that country smile
Of the little girls and boys, they remind me of a child
That I knew and a big harvest moon
That shone by supper time in the dusty afternoon
And I need to be there when the autumn wind goes
Singing through the trestle we would climb
Like brave mountaineers
We never were much bothered by time
Born in the country and I like that country song
We played for just a nickel every time we got to town
And I bought you a dime diamond ring
In the hayloft we would play, we were princesses and kings
And I need to be there when the world
Gets too heavy and the shadows cross my mind
Like brave mountaineers
We never were much bothered by time
Born in the country and I like that country way
Of the uncles aunts and cousins, and the card games they would play
While the young ones slept overhead
Beneath the quilts that mother made, when all the prayers were said
And I need to be there when the autumn wind
Goes singing through the trestle we would climb
Like brave mountaineers
We never were much bothered by time
And I need to be there when the world
Gets too heavy and the shadows cross my mind
Like brave mountaineers
We never were much bothered by time"
"1967" "Is it my imagination or is it my iron pride
I wonder if it matters much if time is on my side
I'd rather press on, I don't wanta rest easy
Anywhere I stray, I will make it a brand new day
Anyway, that is all I've gotta say
I'd rather be by the seaside
Than be playing a one night stand
I've been too wrapped up in my own dreams
I will change things if I can
I gotta press on, don't wanta rest easy
Wouldn't it feel fine to return to the women and the wine
And all of the sunshine that we knew
You will never know what blue is
Until you have played the game
Till you live life in solitaire where
No one knows your name
I'd rather press on, I don't want to rest easy
Have it anyway you will
I will be with you right up until
The spell is broken and all is well
If you'd rather be by the seashore
Well, I sure can understand
Are you too wrapped up in your own scene
I would change things if I can
I'd rather press on, don't want to rest easy
Wouldn't it feel fine
But remembering the rhythm and the rhymes
And all of the good times makes me blue
Wouldn't it feel fine to return to the women and the wine
And all of the sunshine that we knew"
"1968" "I'd like to be in biscuit city
With my banjo in my hand
I don't need no long vacation
In some foreign land
Cause the sound of my own breathing
Has been turning to a sigh
I wish that I could make the time
To be in biscuit city by and by
Oh the water is of emerald
And the beach is white as snow
And everyone's got money
And no place to go
In a land of milk and honey
It can really make you smile
And if I had a ticket
I would stay in biscuit city for a while
All the girls are in bikinis
All the boys are in the buff
With the baby in between and
That makes three of us
And the streets are all so quiet
And the walls are squeaky clean
I think you ain't been nowhere 'til
The town of biscuit city you have seen
I'd rather be in biscuit city
With my banjo in my hand
Than take a big vacation
In some foreign land
Cause the sound of my own breathing
Has been turning to a sigh
If it were not for misfortune
I would be in biscuit city by and by
If it were not for misfortune
I would stay in biscuit city 'til I die"
"1969" "Sit by my side come as close as the air
Sharin' a memory of grey
And wander in my words
And dream about the pictures that I play
Of changes
Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall
To brown and to yellow they fade
And then they have to die
Trapped within the circle time parade
Of changes
Moments of magic will glow in the night
All fears of the forest are gone
For when the morning breaks
They're swept away by golden drops of dawn
Of changes
Passions will part to a warm melody
As fires will sometimes turn cold
Like petals in the wind
We're puppets to the silver strings of souls
Of changes"
"1970" "Oh the prairie lights are burnin' bright
The Chinook wind is a-movin' in
Tomorrow night I'll be Alberta bound
Though I've done the best I could
My old luck ain't been so good and
Tomorrow night I'll be Alberta bound
No one-eyed man could e'er forget
The Rocky Mountain sunset
It's a pleasure just to be Alberta bound
I long to see my next of kin
To know what kind of shape they're in
Tomorrow night I'll be Alberta bound
Alberta bound, Alberta bound
It's good to be Alberta bound
Alberta bound, Alberta bound
It's good to be Alberta bound
Oh the skyline of Toronto
Is somethin' you'll get onto
But they say you've got to live there for a while
And if you got the money
You can get yourself a honey
A written guarantee ta make you smile
But it's snowin' in the city
And the streets and brown and gritty
And I know there's pretty girls all over town
But they never seem ta find me
And the one I left behind me
Is the reason that I'll be Alberta bound
Alberta bound, Alberta bound
It's good to be Alberta bound
Alberta bound, Alberta bound
It's good to be Alberta bound
It's good to be Alberta bound"
"1971" "I was at the break wall, I was lookin' at the sea
In back of the eight ball in some misery
There on the horizon stood a mighty ship of fools
They were headin' into the harbor with all their broken rules
Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I can just pick up the phone
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone
They're better off to be someplace that's a good long way from home
Any way I can lose myself
Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin'
I'm fading away, fading away
They sailed right up to me, I said, \"What's it all about
Please try to excuse me, we can work things out
If you've ever wondered if that mighty ship is real
Let me tell ya 'bout it, brother, it was somethin' you could feel\"
Whenever I'm feelin' lonely, I let twilight set the tone
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone
They're better off to be someplace, that's a good long way to roam
Ain't livin' high on the hog right now
Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin'
I'm fading away, fading away
One more day on the calendar in my mind
I am down at the break wall puttin' in some time
The whole ship of fools has gotten safely under way
And I was proud to be a part of what it was they had to say
Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I can just pick up the phone
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone
They're better off to be someplace that's a good long piece from home
Any way I can lose myself
Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin'
I'm fading away, fading away
Fading away, fading away"
"1972" "I remember everything
I've learned about survival
I've walked with fools and kings
And I've even read the bible
There I came upon some lines
Givin' me direction
Gather not your gold on earth
Your kingdom is in heaven
But I chose to live instead
Inside the shell they gave me
'til in spite of everything
Good fortune came to find me
I tried my best to run away
But I could not avoid the feelin'
Soon I was reelin' on my feet
I made a grab at anything
The earth was gone and I was on
A vicious circle then
After I'd gone and let myself surrender
I didn't want to die at all
I thought I'd live forever
Then she gave me everything
A king could never borrow
But I twisted all her gifts
Her wisdom was my sorrow
So I left her cryin'
And roamed across the river
The angels offered me their hands
But I could not forget her
So I came to where she was
By river, road and reason
I slept beneath her window
In the moonlight summer season
But I could not go inside
I heard the sound of laughter
And the rustle of her hair upon his skin
I made a grab at anything
The earth was gone and I was on
A vicious circle then
After I'd gone to cry down my sorrow
I didn't want to live no more
Nor face the bright tomorrow
Then I remembered everything
I've learned about survival
Havin' walked with fools and kings
I've even read the bible
I remember all those lines
Givin' me direction
Gather not your gold on earth
It will not pass inspection
And still I think when I'm alone
Away from all night splendor
If gold could buy one night with her
I wish I had some to send her"
"1973" "I'm not afraid that when I'm dying
There'll be no one to hold my hand
If there's a God up there, he loves me
As much as my old woman can
I don't intend to be a martyr
I don't give a damn what people say
And if I never get to heaven
Heaven don't deserve me anyway
I've tasted life both good and evil
At times I was cruel and did not pay
And if I never get to heaven
Heaven don't deserve me anyway
I don't know what it was I came for
But I've enjoyed it up 'til now
If there's a friend who ever needs me
I'll do my best to help somehow
I don't intend to keep no secrets
I don't give a damn what people say
And if I never get to heaven
Heaven don't deserve me anyway
I know and I'll admit my failures
I don't give a damn what people say
And if I never get to heaven
Heaven don't deserve me anyway
And if I never get to heaven
Heaven don't deserve me anyway"
"1974" "Does your mother know
You had to go someday
Does your mother know
That you would go so fast
Anyway, that's all you think about
You'd call her if you could
But the letters that you write
In the faded winter light
Just tell her they tell her
That you've got ten dollars
And you'll be all right
And when you get straight
You're gonna come back east some day
Does your mother know
You have a man in the West
Does your mother know
You drove him from your door
Anyway that's all you think about
You'd call her if you could
Does your mother know
You walked all day in the rain
Does your mother know
How deep your love could be
Anyway that's all you think about
You'd call her if you could
But the letters that you write
In the faded winter light
Just tell her they tell her
That you've got ten dollars
And your rent costs eight
And when you get straight
You're gonna come back east some day
But the letters that you write
In the faded winter light
Just tell her they tell her"
"1975" "It's so nice to meet an old friend and pass the time of day
And talk about the home town a million miles away
Is the ice still on the river, are the old folks still the same
And by the way, did she mention my name
Did she mention my name just in passing
And when the morning came, do you remember if she dropped a name or two
Is the home team still on fire, do they still win all the games
And by the way, did she mention my name
Is the landlord still a loser, do his signs hang in the hall
Are the young girls still as pretty in the city in the fall
Does the laughter on their faces still put the sun to shame
And by the way, did she mention my name
Did she mention my name just in passing
And when the talk ran high, did the look in her eye seem far away
Is the old roof still leaking when the late snow turns to rain
And by the way, did she mention my name"
"1976" "I saw a moonlit scene, I never will forget
I stole a kiss at daybreak, I never did regret it
Sometimes I wonder why I even try
So why should I feel blue?
I heard the sound of footsteps swaying in the dark
I poked my head out silent, that's how it started
What to my eyes appeared as dust
Became a vision I don't know
What had finally found me with my back against the wall
Was destiny intruding all around me
And as the day wore on I knew
Another lonely night could never be
If there's is a reason you might try and forget
I'd like to find it 'cause I like to relive it
Sometimes I wonder why I ever cry
So why should I feel blue?
I was caught drifting disappearing from the land
Whitecaps in profusion all around me
But somehow in our eyes I found the strength
To sail upon the raging sea
If theres a reason for the way that life is
I'd like to find it after all who's life is it
Sometimes I wonder why I even try
So why should I feel blue?
What had finally found me with my back against the wall
Was destiny intruding all around me
And as the days wore on I knew
Another lonely night with you could never be
I saw a moonlit scene I know it was real
All that you can ever do when love is reveal
Sometimes I every try why I even try
So why should I feel blue?
Sometimes I wonder why I ever cry
So why should I feel blue?"
"1977" "I think you have somebody waiting
Outside in the rain to take you away
You got places to go, you got people to see
Still I'm gonna miss you
But anyway
I wish you good spaces in
The far away places you go
If it rains or it snows may
You be safe and warm and never grow old
And if you need someone who loves you, why
You know I will always be there
I'll do it although I'm not supposed to care
I'll give you the keys to
My flying machine if you'd like
I will show you the light and when you call
I'm gonna come to you
And when you find someone who loves you,
I'll know you would treat me the same
Just lie there, you're not supposed to care
I think you have somebody waiting
Outside in the rain to take you away.
That's some kind of a game
Still I'm glad it came down
To the final round
But anyway"
"1978" "Make my world a better place to be
Remove these chains and set me free
Give my life one reason to begin
Forgive me lord for I have sinned
Take my hand and lead me as you choose
It seems we ain't got much to lose
Give this place one season without shame
Forgive me lord I've sinned again
I been down on my luck, as a matter of fact
I've even been chaste
Drifting along, singing a song
For the whole human race
I been caught in the act, as a matter of fact
I'm even well known
Floating on by with a laugh and a sigh
On the road that leads home
I got no more time left to roam, if you love me
Take this world and build it as you please
With a little help from the likes of me
Keep it safe from harm and make it pure
Forgive the rich and save the poor
Like the dust on the wind I've been taken again by my foolish pride
Drifting along, singing a song, that's how I get by
I been caught in the act, as a matter of fact I've even been chased
Floating on by with a laugh and a sigh for the whole human race
I got no more time left to waste, if you love me
Make my world a better place to be
Remove these chains and set me free
Give my face a different point of view
Forgive us lord if we run to you
If you love me
Make my world a better place to be
Remove these chains and set me free
Give my life one reason to begin
Forgive me lord for I have sinned
Give my life one reason to begin
Forgive me lord for I have sinned"
"1979" "Alone upon the sidewalks of despair, 'twas there she wandered
With her suitcase in her hand
Her fate she pondered
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
She met him on a night so rare when her friends were there and the band was grooving
When he gave a glance that said how much he would like to meet her
How was she to know at the time he would mistreat her?
In her case she danced for him although a hundred eyes were turned her way
And before the set was through he knew she would be his loved one
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere
He's playing up in Michigan with a group they call The Intended
With a kiss, and a promise, he was gone, the song was ended
But as she walks, she waits for him, the pavement is a shoulder for her tears
But in her heart, she knows there is no way she can hope to change him
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care, a go-go girl in love"
"1980" "I spent most of my life outside, in the driving rain
I was only trying to get by with some of life's amenities
Well, nothing's free, I got more than I bargained for
Now it's plain to see, I can't depend on love to defend me
It took most of my time to do what never was done
I was on the outside of an inside kind of love that now is gone
Come right or wrong, it was laid to rest that way
I hate to be unkind, pretending is for strangers who don't know you
I spent most of my life outside in the driving rain
I was in some one-horse town just waiting for a plane
To take me back now where's that at, I paid the price
Well, ain't that nice, knowing I'm so free?
I can't depend on love to defend me
I got more than I bargained for
Now it's plain to see, I can't depend on love to defend me"
"1981" "Go my way and I'll be good to you
Go my way and your dreams will all come true
In the sunset the wild waves are callin'
My shadow is followin' you
Go my way and I'll take you by the hand
Believe in me and I'll do the best I can
I can't be anything but just what I am
I can't help it if I'm in love with you
Why must I sail my ship alone without a friend
My thoughts are on you, I dare not ask again
Go my way it's the only way to go
If things aren't workin' out, you'll be the first to know
Come on along and together well go
Please love me and say that you'll be mine
Why must I sail my ship alone without a friend
My thoughts are on you, I dare not ask again
Go my way it's the only way to go
If things aren't workin' out, you'll be the first to know

I've been on my own for so long as I stand here today
I'd never leave you, I'll do anything that you say
I've been around some walking on the down the street
Feeling as low as the shoes on the soles of my feet
Taking dead aim on fortune and fame you might say
Playing guitar doesn't make you a star anyway
Many's the time I've wished that I were free
But my love for you was too deep for my eyes to see
I'd never leave you, I'll do anything that you say
Whenever the thought seems better off left alone
I think of you then in a way that is ten times as strong
Taking dead aim on fortune and fame you might say
Playing guitar doesn't make you a star anyway"

When first you held me near
Even though you caused me pain
You were all the world to me

Many fine times went by us
Now it's all so hazy and a little bit crazy
Betty Jo my heart's on fire, I don't need this crying
The next time you see me
In the back seat of a taxi's where I'll be
Betty called me in to say goodnight
Much to my relief and pure delight
I think that was my big love scene
I do believe her engine run all right
Betty said, get ready, the time has come
I was young and my good life had begun
And with the dawn the child in me was gone
Betty made a man out of me that night
Betty made my clothes and sewed my jeans
Listening to my songs and foolish schemes
I think the way she got to me
It would seem like a laser beam right to the soul
Betty my true love do what you do tonight
Where she goes, I hope she knows she's right
The worst of times and the best of times
She was never the kind to kick and bitch and fight
Betty called me in to say goodnight
Much to my relief and pure delight
And with the dawn the child in me was gone
Betty made a man out of me that night
I think that was my big love scene
I do believe her engine run all right"
"1985" "A passing ship
I have found the open ocean
Give me no lip
The waves roll by as I pass on
A sunlit sea
On the first day of April
How fresh the wind
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
How many words
How many songs still unwritten?
How many ships
Of the line have come and gone?
In the good old days
May they never be forgotten
They had heavy wind
Or they had no wind at all
A passing ship
It is midnight on the ocean
Had a real long trip
I have been at sea all winter
When my ship came in
I was givin' up the ghost
I think I should be
Leavin' those passing ships alone
When the sea runs high
The sea runs wild and I'm unsteady
And I think of you
In the warmth of your home and family
When love is true
There is no truer occupation
And may this gale
Blow us to the ones we love
Another day, another ocean
Give me no lip
But stand aside as I pass on
A sunlit sea
On the last day in October
How fresh the wind
Will you miss me from now on?
I guess I should be
Leavin' passing ships alone"

I want to hear it from someone who knows how it is
All the second-hand words seem to get in my way
I want to hear it from you
I want to hear it again
I want to know if the soft scented touch of your lips
Must be taken away like a mother's first kiss to the life that she gives
I've got a right to get it straight from you
To give my life a different point of view
To find a way to keep from losing you
If you don't know what to say
To understand is my life and the question is why
You should cry in the night while your eyes look away
Every time that I speak and there's nothing to say
I want to hear it from you
I want to hear it from you

Tell me where I can run
When my roof tumbles in

I want to hear it from you"

That I'll always be around when you need me
Now I may not be alone each time you see me
Along the street or in a small cafe
But still I won't deny or mistreat you

I'm not sayin' I'll be sorry
For all the things that I might say that make you cry

Somebody made my heart sing
And somebody stole my heart away
Nobody's sayin' their sorry
It's a mighty sweet music
You can dance all night
Put some wood on the fire right now
Ecstasy made easy
Ecstasy I ask you, are you a name
Or just another patron with a smile?
Let me analyze you, are you a flame
Or just the dying embers of a kiss run wild?
Somebody found my heart string
Somebody made my heart sing
And somebody touched my heart last night
Somebody set me in flight
It's a mighty sweet music
Take a chance they say
Put flame on the old iron stove
Ecstasy made easy
It's a mighty sweet music
Take a chance they say
Put some fire on the old iron stove
Ecstasy made easy, made easy
I hope I never lose what belongs to me
By the right of my birth
At midnight sailing out of Perth
Getting under way we turned westward bound
On that southern sea
To sea what ecstasy was worth"
"1990" "When first I did appear upon this native soil
All up and down this country at labor I did toil
I slumbered in the moonlight and I rose with the sun
I rambled through the canyons where the cold rivers run
When first I did come down where the land meets the sea
The people said Who are you and what would your name be
I said I have no home and I am no man's son
'Twas inland I was born and from inland that I come
In the good land I was young and I was strong
No one dared to call me son
Happy just to see my day's work done
See my day's work done
So I swung an axe as a timberjack
And I worked the Quebec mines
And on the golden prairie I rode the big combines
I sailed the maritime waters of many a seaport town
Built the highways and the byways to the western salmon grounds
I've gazed upon the good times I've seen the bad times too
Felt many a cold and bitter wind and many a mornin' dew
I've watched the country growin' like a fair and mighty thing
And on the still of a summer night I've heard the mountains ring
In the good land I was young and I was strong
No one dared to call me son
Happy just to see my day's work done
See my day's work done
But now the seeds are planted and the gates are open wide
The old ways are forgotten there's no place left to hide
And the legacy I'm leavin' you is not very hard to find
You'll see it all around you at this crossroads of time
In the sweet soil it's a-growin' At the crossroads of time"
"1991" "You've been in all my dreams since you've been gone
Each mornin' that I wake up with the dawn
Dream Street Rose I like the way you smile
Dream Street Rose stay with me a while
You gave more than anyone could ask
You washed away all shadows from my past
Dream Street Rose heaven only knows
Dream Street Rose that's the way she goes
Dream Street Rose let us not pretend
Heaven knows will you love me
Right 'til the end
Somewhere in between there stands a dream
The sweetest dream that we have ever seen
Dream Street Rose I like the way you smile
Dream Street Rose please stay with me a while
Dream Street Rose I miss you when you're gone
Heaven knows I'm gonna love ya
From now on
Dream Street Rose I like the way you smile
Dream Street Rose stay with me a while
Dream Street Rose heaven only knows
Dream Street Rose that's the way she goes"
"1992" "Put me somewhere east of midnight
West of the turnpike
Anywhere I wander
Is where I'll take my rest
As I lie down, toss some thoughts around
Dreams I'm told will come true if you
Believe in those who love you right now
Sea of dreams I long for you
Forget about the others
This is my hike, you can come if you like
To feel good, I would help you if I could
But I am out here searching
For the things that might have been
I need no more reminders
Not one love letter have I seen
And that's a pretty good start
The ocean is where lovers meet again
Sea of dreams by all means
Float me out of danger until then
Forever amen
It's a long, long hike
We'll be leavin' early travelin' light
That's alright heaven will be ours tonight
The road is paved with moonbeams
There are faces that I knew
They all came back to haunt me
But that ain't fair to the folks like me and you
It takes a bit of my heart
Tonight I shall be watching from the shore
Sea of dreams from now on
Forget about all the others
Back where the line forms
Destination sea of storms
By all means ever onward sea of dreams
Put me somewhere east of midnight
Along about daylight
Anywhere I wander
Is where I'll take my rest
If we could just lie down, love
Toss some thoughts around
It's a tough and a dirty long hike
You can come if you like
If we could just lie down
Toss some thoughts around"
"1993" "Listen up and I'll tell you what you'll do
Forget about music and alcohol too
Forget about your baby
We got other work for you
Better drink yer glasses empty now
It's time to rise and shine
There's one less cause in the world
To be leaving for
It was back in 39
When I was one year old
Sitting by the backyard fence
And the world had turned so cold
Drink yer glasses empty now
Was all that they were told
Drink yer glasses empty now
It's time to hit the sky
To the tune of thunder
There's no time to wonder why
We'd love to take life over that is plain
Forget about sorrow, forget about pain
And watch a John Wayne movie
To remind us once again
Better drink yer glasses empty now
It's time to hit the line
You got one less cause in the world
To be leaving for
Drink yer glasses girls and boys
It's time to hit the sky
To the tune of thunder
There's a tear in every eye
I'd like to take things one at a time
Forget about reason, forget about rhyme
Because beg, steal or borrow
You got another hill to climb
So drink yer glasses empty now
It's time to hit the road
There's one less cause in the world
To be leaving for
Drink yer glasses girls and boys
It's time to hit the sky
To the tune of thunder
There's no time to wonder why
We'd like to take life over again
When time of war had passed away into the rain
And watch a John Wayne movie
To remind us of the plains
Just drink yer glasses empty now
It's time to rise and shine
There's one less cause in the world
To be leaving for
Listen up and I'll tell you what is true
They done some thinking and they changed a thing or two
You been living in the hindsight
Of a backwards point of view
So drink yer glasses empty now
It's time to hit the road
There's one less cause in the world
To be leaving for"
"1994" "At times I just don't know
How you could be anything but beautiful
I think that I was made for you
And you were made for me
And I know that I won't ever change
We've been friends through rain or shine
For such a long, long time
Laughing eyes and smiling face
It seems so lucky just to have the right
Telling you with all my might
You're beautiful tonight
And I know that you won't ever stray
'Cause you've been that way from day to day
For such a long, long time
And when you hold me tight
How could life be anything but beautiful
I think that I was made for you
And you were made for me
And I know that I won't ever change
We've been friends through rain or shine
For such a long, long time
Well, I must say it means so much to me
To be the one who's telling you
I'm telling you, that you're beautiful"
"1995" "There's a love I hold dear
And it shines through each year
And it makes things seem different somehow
It's for better or worse
It's for people who thirst
For a love that burns brighter right now
And it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone
And if children had wings I would sing them this song
With a smile on my face and a tear in my eye
Everything will be fine by and by
There were things that were said
There were things that were done
And a wife cannot stand too much pain
And what I thought was best
Couldn't please her much less
But my love still goes on, that don't change
And it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone
And if children had wings I would sing them this song
With a smile on my lips and a tear in my eye
Everything will be fine by and by
And it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone
And if children had wings I would sing them this song
With a smile on my face and a tear in my eye
Everything will be fine by and by
And it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone
And if children had wings I would sing them this song
With a smile on my face and a tear in my eye
Everything will be fine by and by"
"1996" "Bells of the evening, O sing to my love
Tell her I miss her, my own turtledove
The streets of the old town are covered with rain
I think I might never know true love again
I'm lost with no road signs to guide me
A slave to my whisky and dreams
Bells of the evening, O bells that I love
I've got some feelings I long to be rid of
I'm not one to ramble; I'm not one to boast
Though I had one lover more lovely than most
She was a country girl born to be free
Who took to the city by chance there to find me
Bells of the evening go pealin'
I'm down here listenin' to you
Bells of the evening, O bells of the sea
Tell her that I love her, that I'm lost and so lonely
Bells of the evening, your sweet Sunday sound
Reminds me of the redwoods and moss covered ground
So if I should wander on back to the coast
Tell her to remember it's her I need the most
I'm caught by the minstrel's misfortune
Of being forever displaced
Bells of the evening, O bells of the sea
Tell her that I love her; That I'm lost I'm so lonely"
"1997" "The night is as black as the coal dust on the tracks
Up to the east day is dawning
From time to time I get women on my mind
I'm a son of a gun
Borderstone, borderstone gonna cross your line tonight
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight
The train that I'm on is a hundred boxcars long
So I don't sleep through to the morning
That's some chilly wind in this gondola I'm in
I wish I had a glass of beer
Borderstone, borderstone gonna cross your line tonight
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight
Borderstone, borderstone gonna cross your line tonight
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight
The boardinghouse reach is a thing no school can teach you
I confess I've been outfumbled
And the sound of the beans boiling through the evergreens
Sure do please a hungry man
Borderstone, borderstone gonna cross your line tonight
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight
Borderstone, borderstone gonna cross your line tonight
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight
The sound of the wheels rebounds across the fields
I'm a name with no number
And so I guess I'd be drifting more or less
But still it's not meant to be
Borderstone, borderstone gonna cross your line tonight
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight
Borderstone, borderstone gonna cross your line tonight
Borderstone, pretty little town, gonna make my bed tonight
Borderstone, borderstone gonna cross your line tonight

"1998" "She walks be the sea where the seaworld is
And she waits for the man to come
She lives in town with her high-heeled friends
And she knows it's a long way down
But she doesn't have to get up in the morning
With her hair so soft and long
Daylight Katy come on
Daylight Katy come on
If you can't follow me down
Daylight Katy go home
Daylight Katy come on
Daylight Katy come on
If you can't follow me down
Daylight Katy go home
She walks to the sea where the seaweed is
Where the rust and the dirt runs deep
She lives nine lives in her midnight world
While her old man's fast asleep
And she doesn't have to get up in the mornin'
With her hair so soft and long
Daylight Katy come on
Daylight Katy come on
If you can't follow me down
Daylight Katy go home
Daylight Katy come on
Daylight Katy come on
If you can't follow me down

She lives by the sea when the summer wind comes
And the sea don't mind at all
She talks to the sea when the sea runs wild
And the waves run steep and tall
And she doesn't have to get up in the mornin'
With her hair so soft and long
Daylight Katy come on
Daylight Katy come on
If you can't follow me down

"1999" "All the lovely ladies in their finery tonight
I wish that I could know them one by one
All the handsome gentlemen with loving on their minds
Strolling in to take the ladies home
Bless you all and keep you on the road to tenderness
Heaven can be yours just for now.
All the gentle strangers who by nature do not smile
To everyone who cannot hold a pen
To all you heavy rounders with a headache for your pains
Who dread the thought of going 'round the bend
Bless you all and keep you on the road to better things
Heaven can be yours just for now.
To all the lovely ladies in their finery tonight
I wish that I could kiss you while you knit
To all the ones who learn to live with bein' second-guessed
Whose job it is to give more then to get
Bless you all and keep you with the strength to understand
Heaven can be yours just for now.
To all the little dreamers with a dream that cannot last
To all the sleeping giants who must wake
To every man who answers to the letter of the law
And all the rest imprisoned by mistake
Bless you all and keep you with the faith to let it pass
Heaven can be yours just for now
To all the lonely sailors who have trouble beeing seen
To all of you with heartache that remains
Maybe sometime later you might swim back into shore
If someone could relieve you of your chains
Bless you all and keep you all on the land or on the sea
Heaven can be yours, just for now"
"2000" "\"Nothing is for certain\"
That's what the showman said
First you must open the curtain
And stand 'em on their heads
There can be no inhibitions
No prima donna ways
If you want to pass the audition
And times is tough these days
Remember when Mr. Barnum
Presented Jenny Lind
They named a candy after her
A circus after him
End of my story
The rest is history
She in all of her glory
He lived quietly
He needed her, she needed him
As sure as the skies above
In a way it was for them
A lesson in love, a lesson in love
You look like the moon glow
That follows me home
Always makes me turn around
Won't leave me alone
First to come are the midgets
A monkey and a kid
Followed by those two one-armed jugglers
The ego and the id
Songs of the season
Apples of the sun
There is no rhyme or reason
Just a time for each and every one
Hang on Mr. Barnum
Hang on Jenny Lind
We will meet you in streets of gold
Where eternity begins
We will let it all hangout
Go hand in glove
Life was meant to live and learn
A lesson in love, a lesson in love"
"2001" "His father was a man who could never understand
The shame on a red man's face
So they lived in the hills and they never came down
But to trade in the white man's place
It was early in the spring when the snow had disappeared
They came down with a bag of skins
In the fall of the year of 1910
Daddy died by the rope down in Cherokee Bend.
Daddy didn't like what the white man said
'Bout the dirty little kid at his side
Daddy didn't like what the white man did
Nor the deal or the way that he lied
There was blood on the floor of the government store
When the men took his daddy away
But the boy stayed back till he come to his end
And he run like the wind from Cherokee Bend.
Now the mother was alone and the winter was at hand
And she prayed to her spirit kin
It was warm in the lodge in the Kentucky hills
On the day when the boy came in
Then a blizzard came down and it covered up the door
Till they thought that it never would end
And he told her the tale of the terrible affair
In the government store down in Cherokee Bend
Daddy didn't like what the white man said
'Bout the dirty little kid at his side
Daddy didn't like what the white man did
Nor the deal or the way that he lied
For three long days and three long nights
They wept and they mourned and then
She returned to her work and her weavin'
And they tried to forget about Cherokee Bend
Now the boy wasn't big but he hunted what he could
And they lived for a time that way
But the food run low and the meat went bad
And she said to the boy one day
I'm leaving tonight and I never will return
>From the land of my Spirit Kin
You must take what you need and trade what you can
For a Red Man's grave down in Cherokee Bend
It wasn't very long till she closed her eyes
And he wrapped her in a robe
He found her a place on the side of the hill
And he buried her in the snow
Early in the spring he was seen in the town
With his load looking ragged and thin
Not a year had gone by till he stood once again
In the government store down in Cherokee Bend
He was ten years tall and a Redskin too
So he hadn't much face to save
And the men sat around and they laughed and they clowned
At the talk of a criminal's grave
Then the man from the east didn't smile when he said
You're the son of that Indian scum
If you value your hide then you better abide
By the white man's rules here in Cherokee Bend.
Daddy didn't like what the white man said
'Bout the dirty little kid at his side
Daddy didn't like what the white man did
Nor the deal or the way that he lied
And he spit on the floor of the government store
And it served him to no good end
At the close of the day they had taken him away
To the white man's school down at Cherokee Bend
It's been 21 years since the boy disappeared
Where he run to, nobody knows
But they say he fell in with a man named Jim
And he rides in the rodeos
And they say he returns all alone to a place
Hidden deep in the Kentucky glen
And it's pretty well known who hauled up the stone
To the grave on the hill above Cherokee Bend
Daddy didn't like what the white man said
'Bout the dirty little kid at his side
Daddy didn't like what the white man did
Nor the deal or the way that he lied
There was blood on the floor of the government store
When the men took his daddy away
It was 1910 and they never had a friend
When he died by the rope down at Cherokee Bend
It was 1910 and they never had a friend
When he died by the rope down at Cherokee Bend"
"2002" "He was standin' by the highway
With a sign that just said \"mother\"
When he heard a driver comin'
'bout a half a mile away
Then he held the sign up higher
Where no decent soul could miss it
It was ten degrees or colder
Down by bolder dam that day
He was raised up in milwaukee
Though he never was that famous
He was just a road musician
To the taverns he would go
Singin' songs about the ramblin'
The lovin' girls and gamblin'
How the world fell on his shoulders
Back in boulder I don't know
It was out in arizona
That he heard the lady listenin'
To each word that he was sayin'
To each line that he would write
So he sat down by her table and
They talked about the weather
Ninety-eight point six and risin'
Down by boulder dam that day
And she told him she would take him
For a ride in the mornin' sun
Back in boulder he had told her
\"I don't know when I had a better friend\"
Now he's traded off his martin
But his troubles are not over
For his feet are almost frozen
And the sun is sinkin' low
Won't you listen to me brother
If you ever loved your mother
Please pull off on the shoulder
If you're goin' milwaukee way
It's ten degrees and getting colder
Down by boulder dam today"
"2003" "In my life
In my time and in each line I've ever sung
And in my life
Was it my imagination or are you still the one
Who lingers on
I'd do anything for you
You'd do anything for me
We'd do anything for love
Ohh, you'd use any means
And I would try any scheme for love
We'd do anything for love
Once or twice
In my loneliness I watched the world go by
There was I
One too many miles beyond where you might say
Some luck was due, after all
We could have touched the sky
You had no alibi because
We'd do anything for love
Ohh, I would try any means
To have you in all my dreams because
You'd do anything for love
Not long ago as I remember
Once upon a dark and windy day
When love looked like a dying ember
Before you came to call
The beauty of it all, I though I'd lost and yet
'Cause in my life
There in my mind in it now shines
A guiding light
Never again will I lose my way
Ohh, I would not tell a lie and
You had no alibi because
We'd do anything for love
Ohh, you'd use any means
And I would try any scheme for love
Simply anything for love
Ohh, I would do anything
Just about anything because
We'd do anything for love
Anything for love
Anything for love
Anything for love"

Before you're lyin' high and dry
I hope you find your way back home
Before you die
Her sails blow like bubbles
While ya sip yer daily doubles
If she wasn't so fond of the weather
She might give the deckhands trouble
Singin' why me oh my
Is there a better man than I
I hope you find your way back home
Before you're lyin' high and dry
I hope you find your way back home
Before you die
One day when I grew older
And I found I could not hold her
She took on a fine young skipper
Who soon run her up on a boulder
Singin' why me oh my
Is there a better man than I
I hope you find your way back home
Before you're lyin' high and dry
I hope you find your way back home
Before you die
Now the pleasures of the harbor
Don't include a lady barber
If it wasn't for Long John Silver
All of us pirates would've been martyrs
Singin' why me oh my
Is there a better man than I

Through two shipwrecked eyes I've come to see
Everything I had to give has been given to you
Baby, that's the way it all should be
Always on the bright side
Keeps it kind of light
That girl gets friendlier each day
Love alone will keep me breathing all through the night
In that quiet place where dreams abide
You and I together are a bit of all right
Feeling good is how we wish to be
Always on the bright side
Always out of sight
Nesting like two eagles in the trees

Always out of sight

Nor gowns of soft crimson hue
Nor poems of love no rhymes to bring her
Into my heart so strong so true

Within the valley so free
There dwells a maid with a heart so mellow
Soft as the wind and wild as the sea

Gives us some problems of our own
If you turn back to that page again
And you can't win, if you ask me, I'll tag along
Paper matches in the afternoon
Cups of tea and all of that Zen
I think, it's time we took a walk outside
It seems there is no oxygen
This time tomorrow, we might all be packed and gone
I believe, it's best we carry on
Smoke rings rising 'til they disappear
In the sky above, if you ask me, I'll tag along
Each and every bad dream will be hammered into dust
When we get back where we belong
If you ever turn that page again
You need a friend, if you ask me, I'll tag along

What you're thinking could be anybody's guess
All I'm after is the sun and the summer nights
By the seashore, don't want no more neon lights
Just the sand and the sky as the hours roll by
Ain't it funny, how the world seems to be back there in my dreams
All I see is my reflection in your wild and winsome ways
Ain't it funny, life feels different every day
All I'm after is to be the flame in your tattoo
Be the one girl who can thrill me through and through
This is just a guess but I must confess
It feels better being certain
Please excuse my truthfulness
What I'm seeing's worth believing
When you thrill me like you do
So you wonder why my feelings never fade
I think I got it made
In the evening when the rain begins to fall
That's when I wonder if you think of me at all
But you sound so sad, in your special way
Ain't it funny, life feels different with each new passing day
All I need is my reflection in your wild and windswept ways
Ain't it funny how life changes every day"

You'll never be the same

You might even learn a thing or two approaching Lavender
You'll soon be on a one night tour
Forgetting your own name
You won't need a reason just to be alone with Lavender
For the light so warm and pure
Will draw you like a flame
The colors that surround you there will be the shade of Lavender
Shadows dancing everywhere
Like flowers in the rain
You will find your tongue's on fire while lying next to Lavender
With words you never spoke before
And will not speak again
Oh sweet Lavender, I understand you perfectly
There is no way that I can see
You living by yourself
Oh sweet Lavender, I must be with you constantly
Your presence means so much to me
Much more that life itself
Oh sweet Lavender, as fragrant as the name you bear
Please cast away the clothes you wear
And give your love to me
Oh sweet Lavender, your smile is like the golden sun
I'd love to see you laugh and run
As naked as the sea
If you'd like to spend the afternoon approaching Lavender
Don't try and get the best of her
She will not share the blame
If you'd like to try your hand at understanding Lavender

Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind!"
"2021" "Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you,
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on
Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go till we're gone
Love was when I loved you
One true time I hold to
In my life we'll always go on
Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
You're here, there's nothing I fear,
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart
And my heart will go on and on"

"2027" "Night time sharpens, hightens each sensation. Darkness stirs and wakes imagination. Silently the sences abanden their defences.
Slowly, gently, night unfurls it's splendor. Grasp it, sence it, tremulous and tendor. Turn your face away from the garish light of day. Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light and listen to the music of the night.
Close your eyes and serendor to your darkest dreams, perge all thoughts of the life you knew before. Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar. And you'll live as you've never lived before.
Softly, deaftly, music shall caress you. Hear it, feel it, secretly posess you. Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind, in this darkness that you know you can not fight, the darkness of the music of the night.
Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world. Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before. Let your soul take you where you long to be, only then, can you belong to me.
Floating, falling, sweet intoxication. Touch me, trust me, savour each sensation. Let the dream begin, let your darkest side give in, to the power of the music that I write. The power of the music of the night.
You alone can make my song take flight. Help me make the music of the night."

When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seems to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me
Don't cry for me Argentina
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

Kom met me mee naar Maastricht
Voor wie niet weet waar dat ligt
Ergens in het uiterste zuiden van het land
Parel van het Limburgse land
Stad met een eigen gezicht
Door de Romeinen gesticht
En door de Fransen beinvloed als geen
Kom maar, dan gaan we er heen
Kom met me mee en flaneer
Proef die Bourgondisch sfeer
Stad van traditie van wierook en bier
Altijd het grootste plezier
Stad aan de kolkende Maas
Weinig bezongen helaas
Stad zoals jij bent, zo is er niet een
Kom maar dan gaan we er heen
Hmmmm Hmmmmmm
Kom met me mee naar Maastricht
Stad met het oude gezicht
Stokoude straten maar jong nog van hart
Altijd een beetje apart
Stad aan de kolkende Maas

Stad als een onuitgesproken gedicht

We used to laugh and dance and live

Where human hearts are staunch and true; I shall start my life anew.
Goodbye, it's time I sought a foreign clime,

And so I go to fight the savage foe,
Although I know that I'll be sometimes missed by the girls I've kissed.

And fall for the flag if I must.

And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away
Like the sunflower

Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan
Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Every streetlamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters
And the streetlamp gutters
And soon it will be morning
Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I musn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin
Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning
Touch me
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

How your man stayed up on the surfboard after 14 pints of stout.
I dreamt a dream the other night, jaysus I couldn't sleep a wink,
The rats were tryin' to count the sheep and I was tryin' to get off the drink.
There was footsteps in the parlour and voices on the stairs,
And I was climbin' up the walls and I was movin' round the chairs.
I looked out from under the blanket, and up at the fireplace,
There was the Pope and John F. Kennedy and Jack Charlton and the three of them were starin' in me face.
And suddenly it dawned at me, hey by God I think I'm getting the D.T.s,
When the Child o' Prague began to dance around the mantlepiece.

I tell ya my heart was palpitatin', I was sure it was going to stop.

And ten pounds to St. Anthony to help me find some sleep.
I fell into an awful nightmare, and got a dreadful shock.
When I dreamt there was no duty-free in the airport down in Knock.
II dreamt Ian Paisley was sayin' the rosary and Mother Theresa was taking the pill.
And Frank Patterson was out of his head be God and he was singin' Spancil Hill.

I dreamt I was in ecstacy in Heaven and agony in Hell, I was bored in limbo,
And then I was in purgatory as well.
And there was original sins and venial sins,
And mortal by the score.
So I tied barbed wired around my underpants and I flagilated myself on the floor.
Then I dreamt I was in the confessional box and the auld Bishop said to me, he said,
\"Any impure thoughts my child?\" - the fuckin' barbed wire was killing me!
And then I dreamt I was in the jacuzzi with that auld hoor in number 10,
And then I knew that I'd never ever, ever drink again.

Working together we learned how to cope
Chorus:
Life is an ocean and love is a boat
In troubled water that keeps us afloat
When we started the voyage, there was just me and you
Now gathered round us, we have our own crew
Together we're in this relationship
We built it with care to last the whole trip
Our true destination's not marked on any charts
We're navigating to the shores of the heart
Chorus 2x"
"2207" "I'm goin' to saddle up me old grey mare,
I'm goin' to ride through the night,
Without a worry or a care.
I'm a messenger boy, bringing my love to you.
I see the light in the bedroom,
I pray to God that I didn't come too soon.
Two big dogs and a man shouts \"Who goes there ?\"
I've ridden through the cold and the wind and the rain and the frost,
And the snow and I'm love and I do not feel the pain.
I'm a messenger boy, bringing my love to you.
(Fade out / ad lib vocals etc)
(gd/naas)"
"2208" "Beauty picks me up than throws me to the floor
I may never know what i was searching for,
like a begger on my knees, never knowing what i now believe
like a drug I took the walk back to your door,
I had had enough but I always want more
there was something I was needing..........
Something you were keeping.......
and than with the rest of my days before me
I broke down and fell asleep
to your beating heart , your beating heart, your beating heart
In the worst of all the best times we have shared,
through a sea of every now forgotten tear,
you would look me in the eye so afraid to ask me,\" why?\"
but i knew you were the star that shines for me,
and i had already planned to set us free,
and in the black of the night i would ask you to be mine."
"2209" "riving in a trance through your lost and lonely town
Something in the air that could blow your whole house down
Something like a tragedy
Something that you think you need
Turning on a dime you pull into your local store
Aisles going by and you forget what you're looking for
Maybe it's a pot of gold
Maybe you're too lost to know
Maybe what you need is a different kind of love
One that you have never seen
Maybe all you are is a part of a star on a long journey
Maybe what you need is a better kind of love
One that you could only dream
Maybe it will take all the sorrow away
And let you feel free
Nothing like a storm in your heart to wake you up
Someone by your side and you know they're not enough
Maybe you should try and stay
Maybe you should walk away
Maybe what you need is a different kind of love
One that you have never seen
Maybe all you are is a part of a star on a long journey
Maybe what you need is a better kind of love
One that you could only dream
Maybe it will take all the sorrow away
And let you feel free
Maybe you wake up to a brighter sun
Voices in your head screaming now the change has come
With a different kind of love
Maybe what you need is a different kind of love
One that you have never seen
Maybe all you are is a part of a star on a long journey
Maybe what you need is a different kind of love
Maybe all you are is a part of a star on a long journey
Maybe what you need is a better kind of love
Maybe it will take all the sorrow away and let you feel free"
"2210" "Woke up early from my bed
With a secret in my head
In the back of my backyard
I keep a spaceship in the shed
I lit the engine and took the sky
From up here it looks so nice
I didn't stop until the moon, where I
Picked a flower just for you
[Chorus]
And I fell down to you in a parachute of
Newspaper rubber bands, tape, and glue
So you would see I would do anything for you
Anything for you
I didn't want to wake you up,
So I put the flower in a cup
On the floor next to your bed
Without a sound I laid my head
Drifted off into a dream
Of what has been and what could be
I saw your tears, I saw you fall
But I saw us rise, I saw it all
And I fell down to you in a parachute of
Newspaper rubber bands, tape, and glue
So you would see that I would do anything for you
Anything for you
And I never want you to know
All of the lengths I'll go
To find where the flowers grow
Love is never supposed to be
A present under our tree
I do it because I believe
[Chorus]
I fell down to you in a parachute of
Newspaper rubber bands, tape, and glue
So you would see that I would do anything for you
Anything for you
Anything for you"
"2211" "Deep is the water under my bridge,
Flowing
Short is the lifetime that I've lived,
Knowing
Messing up and starting over
Again
Maybe all the breaks
And the young mistakes
Were supposed to carry me here
This time I gotta get it right gotta get it right
Now gotta get it right this time
Lord knows I've let myself down too many times, many times yea
This time I gotta get it right gotta get it right
Now gotta get it right this time
My life is passing me by gotta take a deep breath,
And get it right
Looking for answers what have I missed, someone
I want to be so much better than this, in the long run
Stepping forward and falling backwards again
When I get
The breaks
Will the young
Mistakes be the ones to carry me on
This time I gotta get it right gotta get it right
Now gotta get it right this time
Lord knows I've let myself down too many times, many times
This time I gotta get it right gotta get it right
Now gotta get it right this time
My life is passing me by gotta take a deep breath
And get it right
I know I'll get there, things will get better
Better with every day
And what lies behind me, will not define me.
I tell myself nothing can stop me now
This time I gotta get it right gotta get it right
Now gotta get it right this time
My life is passing me by gotta take a deep breath
This time I gotta get it right gotta get it right now
Gotta get it right this time
Lord knows I've let myself down too many times, many times
This time I gotta get it right gotta get it right
Now gotta get it right this time
My life is passing me by gotta take a deep breath, and get it right
And get it right"
"2212" "Weve come closer than we wanted, weve seen what we never should
And we will not be the same. Well never be the same, no.
Like steel we are so resilient, but too much and were weak as children.
We were not meant to be made witness to these scenes, no.
Gunshots in a broken palace, planes crashing and burn around us
Its different than it ever was, darker than its ever been
Three shouts and thank God I found you
With the crowd and the fog around you Ill never let you fall, Ill never let you fall
Oh Heaven can you hear us
Right now we are not sure
But I hope it will get better
These times were in together, theyre changing us forever
Two kids in a crooked alley, school canceled again
And now they wont learn a single lesson except how to load a weapon
And right here on this old soil we hope for peace and we pray for joy
But like everybody else were still fighting with ourselves
Oh heaven can you hear us
Right now we are not sure
But I hope it will get better
These times were in together, theyre changing us forever
Oh heaven can you hear us
Right now we are not sure
I hope it will get better
These times were in together, theyre changing us forever
Oh heaven can you hear us
Right now we are not sure
But I hope it will get better
These times were in together, theyre changing us forever"
"2213" "I'm smarter than your average Jonathan or Joe
I could fill a hundred suitcases with everything I know
But I am stupid for your love
Aurora borealis makes perfect sense to me,
Its light particles and magnets
I'm smart enough to see
But I am stupid for your love
I still remember 30 numbers after 3.14 pi.
Don't ask me why...
And with a Rubix cube I'll make a fool of
Anyone who tries to beat my time
But I am stupid for your love
I know I am so stupid for your love
I love to read the classics
They're not too long for me,
I read 'em in one sitting
Like I did with War and Peace
But I am stupid for your love
And I got a lot of street smarts
From years of looking out,
I've seen the biggest cities
And I know what they're about
But I am stupid for your love
I still remember 30 numbers after 3.14?
Don't ask me why
And with a Rubix cube I'll make a fool of
Anyone who tries to beat my time
But I am stupid for your love
I am stupid for your love [4x]"
"2214" "She is packing in slow motion the sun is coming up
I am sitting in the next room staring in my coffee cup
Now we are driving down the shoreline, this car is cut in two
I am quiet, she is humming, When the stars go blue
And pulling up to J.F.K.
There really isn't much to say
[Chorus]
Don't tell me you'll write me, don't tell me you'll call
Just tell me you'll see me in the fall
Don't give me a promise you know you'll never keep
Go and find it all and I'll see you in the fall
Now I'm back at our apartment and nothing feels the same
Her coat is gone, her toothbrush is missing,
All the flowers start to fade
And September feels so far away
[Chorus]
Let you fly away from me, fate will bring you back to me
And darling that's all we have
Don't write don't call I'll see you in the fall
Don't write don't call I'll see you in the fall"

We don't need no medication
We've got all our vital signs
All this noise and light pollution
I just wanna see the stars tonight
We're gonna walk out of this city
Leaving everything behind
We can sleep the days
And cover ground at night
Until we find that emerald sky
Now there's plastic in the valley
There's still heartache in the ghetto
I need to talk to someone face to face
This place, no, it doesn't feel like home
We don't need no medication
We've got all our vital signs
All this noise and light pollution
I just wanna see the stars tonight
We're gonna walk out of this city
Leaving everything behind
We can sleep the days
And cover ground at night
Until we find that emerald sky
I'm gonna find that place that we forgot
Where I don't care about the money you've got
Where I don't need much 'cause it don't take a lot
We're gonna go
We're gonna walk out of this city
Leaving everything behind

Tell your family they can wait your
Only young once and only dream of
The day that love will steal you away
So run with me down these midnight streets, we will take
Nothing for granted, nothing for granted
Come with me life is short and sweet, we will take
Nothing for granted, nothing for granted
Stop the seasons drifting by,
Stop believing there's no time
Stop your heart from closing off, I think you deserve it all
Love your future,
Love your past,
Love your body it's all you have
Love your secrets bottled up, but love them more when you give them up
And run with me down these midnight streets, we will take
Nothing for granted, nothing for granted
Come with me life is short and sweet, we will take
Nothing for granted, nothing for granted
You gotta get outta your mind,
There's so many wonders to find
There's so many words they could write across your early grave
So come on and open your eyes, I will be right by your side
And we will see love lies in everything
Run with me down these midnight streets, we will take
Nothing for granted, nothing for granted
Nothing for granted, nothing for granted

Don't need no one to save me now
I'm gonna let my body drown
And keep my head above the water
Let it rain on me, let it rain on me

Let it rain on me, let it rain on me
And like a single ray of light
It can pierce the darkest night
I was meant to make it through
So let the future crash on me
And let the water set me free
Nobody wins before they lose
Let it rain on me,
Let my shelter crumble down
Take it all away,

How could I be lonely

A sandwich a pose and a bunch of friends
The fourth of July, out on Sullivan
I gotta get back to a place so real, it's so real
I always wanna feel like I do in Charleston
I tell you thats the way that life should be
I always wanna love like I love in Charleston
Oh how I love you Charleston

Cracking my mothers voice

Filling my pockets with paper
Smoking em deep in the woods

Strike up a tune in the ropes and the rig!
Blow, lucky breeze, come kiss the white canvas,
the anchors are up, boys, it's time for a swig.
No don't turn your backs, boys, let's face the land squarely,
watching her glimmer away in the mists.
We gave her our guts, but she fed us just barely.
We'll go where there's use for our backs and our fists!
Blow, silver wind, with a sight from the mountains.
Whisper a word from the hills and the streams.
Blow, wind of sorrow, hasten the hour.
Let us be gone now. There's no time for dreams.
No, don't turn around. Pray the wind will keep blowing.
There is no returning so don't look behind.
What we have lost there is no way of knowing.
No way of knowing what we shall find...
Blow, silver wind, with a song from the mountains!
Wish us God speed with a cheer from afar!
Blow, wind of hope, for your children departing.
We know what you gave us. We know who we are.

already she's wetting her nose in the brine.
So, look to the East where the old land is waning,

The terror o' the Hielan glens, that was The Portree Kid
(chorus)
He drum ho, he drum hey
The teuchter that cam frae Skye
(chorus)
His sidekick was an orra' man and oh but he was mean
He was ca'd The Midnight Plough-Boy and he cam fae Aberdeen
He had twenty seven notches on his cromack so they say
And killed a million Indians, way up in Stornoway
Portree booted in the door, he sauntered tae the bar
He poured a shot o' crabbies, he shouted \"Slainte Mhath\"
While midnight was being chatted up by a bar room girl called Pam
Who said well howdy stranger, would you buy's a babycham
Now over in the corner sat three men fae Auchtertool
They were playing games for money, in a snakes and ladders school
The fourth man was a southerner who'd come up from Macmerry
He'd been a river gambler, on the Ballachulish Ferry
(chorus)
Portree walked tae the table and he shouted shake me in
He shoogled on the eggcup, he gave the dice a spin
He threw seven sixes in a row and the game was nearly done
But then he landed on a snake, and finished on square one
The game was nearly over and Portree was daein fine
He'd landed on a ladder, he was up tae forty nine
He only had but one to go and the other man was beat
But the gambler couped the board off, and shouted you're a cheat
Men dived behind the rubber plants to try and save their skins
The accordionist stopped playing, his sidekick dropped the spoons
He says I think its funny, you've been up that ladder twice
And ye a'ways dunt the table, when I go to throw my dice
(chorus)
The gambler drew his Sgian Dubh as fast as lightning speed
Portree grabbed a screwtop, he cracked him o'er the heid
Then he gave him laldy wi' a salmon off the wall
And he finished off the business, wi' his lucky grousefoot's claw
Portree walked up tae the bar, he says I'll hae a half
And d'ye like the way I stuck it on that wee Macmerry nyaff
But the Southerner crept up behind his features wracked wi' pain
And gubbed him wi' an ashtray, made oot o' a curling stane
The fight went raging on all night till opening time next day
Wi' a break for soup and stovies aff a coronation tray
It was getting kind o' obvious, that neither man would win
When came the shout that stopped it all, there's a bus trip comin' in
(chorus)
They sing this song in Galashiels and up by Peterheid
Way down o'er the border, across the Rio Tweed
But what became o' Portree, Midnight and the gamblin' man,
They opened up a gift shop selling fresh air in a can
(chorus)
Frae Skye
Frae Skye
Frae Skye
Frae Skye"

"2232" "I once loved a lass
I loved her sae weel
I hated all others who spoke of her ill
But now she's rewarded me well for my love
For she's gone to be wed to another
I saw my love to the church go
With bridesgroom and bridesmaidens they made a fine show
And I followed on with my heart full of woe
She was gone to be wed to another
I saw my love sit down to dine
As I sat down beside her I poured out the wine
I drank to the lassie that should have been mine
Even though she'd been wed to another
The men o' the forest
They ask it o' me
How many strawberries grow in the south sea?
I answer them a' with a tear in my ee'
How many ships sail in the forest"

"2238" "Notes: The song is a lament for a lost love
killed in battle. He will now take the \"low road\", or the spiritual road, back home to Scotland,
while Moira (his love) stays on the \"high road\" or the earthbound road.
This concept is based on a Celtic myth that stated
when a Scotsmen died in a foreign land, they took the low road back home.
They will never meet again in this life
but they will
some day meet again
far above the bonnie banks of Loch lomond.
O wither away my bonnie May(which direction) Sae late an' sae far in the gloamin' (so far) (Gloaming = dusk/twilight) The mist gathers grey o'er moorland and brae (hill) O wither sae far are ye roamin'?
Chorus:
O ye'll tak the high road an' I'll tak the low I'll be in Scotland afore ye For me and my true love will never meet again By the bonnie bonnie banks o' Loch Lomond
I trusted my ain love last night in the broom (own) (bush) My Donald wha' loves me sae dearly For the morrow he will march for Edinburgh toon (town) Tae fecht for his King and Prince Charlie (to fight)
O well may I weep for yestreen in my sleep (yesterday), we stood bride and bridegroom together. But his arms and his breath were as cold as the death And his heart's blood ran red in the heather
(Chorus)
As dauntless in battle as tender in love He'd yield ne'er a foor toe the foeman (enemy) But never again frae the field o' the slain (from) Tae his Moira will he come by Loch Lomond
The thistle may bloom, the King hae his ain (have his own) And fond lovers may meet in the gloamin' And me and my true love will yet meet again Far above the bonnie banks of Loch Lomond

"2239" "I'll sing you my October song
There is no song before it
The words and tune are not my own
My joy and sorrow bore it
Beside the sea
the brambly brier
In the still of evening
Birds fly out from behind the sun
And with them I'll be leaving
The fallen leaves bejewel the ground
They know the art of dying
And leave with joy their glad gold hearts
In scarlet shadows lying
When hunger calls my weary footsteps home
The morning follows after
I swim the seas within my mind
The pine trees laugh green laughter
I met a man who's name was time
He said \"I must be going\"
But just how long ago that was
I have no way of knowing
Sometimes I could murder time
When my heart is aching
But mostly I just like to stroll along
The path that he is taking"

"2241" "Dear sir I write this note to you to tell you of my plight.
For at the time of writing it I'm not a pretty sight.
My body is all black & blue, my face a deathly grey.
And I write this note to say why I am not at work today.
While working on the 14th floor some bricks I had to clear.
But tossing them down from such a height was not a good idea.
The foreman wasn't very pleased, he is an awkward sod.
And he said I had to cart them down the ladders in me hod.
Well clearing all these bricks by hand, it was so very slow.
So I hoisted up a barrel and secured a rope below.
But in my haste to do the job, I was too blind to see.
That a barrel full of building bricks was heavier than me.
And so when I untied the rope the barrel fell like lead.
And clinging tightly to the rope I started up instead .
I shot up like a rocket and to my dismay I found.
That half way up I met the bloody barrel coming down.
The barrel broke my sholder as to the ground it sped.
And when I reached the top I banged the pulley with my head.
I clung on tightly numb with shock from this almighty blow.
While the barrel spilled out half its bricks some 14 floors below.
Now when these bricks had fallen from the barrel to the floor.
I then out-weighed the barrel and so started down once more.
But I clung on tightly to the rope, my body racked with pain.
And half way down I met the barrel once again.
The force of this collision half way down the office block.
Caused multiple abbraisions and a nasty case of shock.
But I clung on tightly to the rope as I fell towards the ground.
And landed on the broken bricks the barrel had scattered round.
Well as I lay there on the floor I thought I'd passed the worst.
But the barrel hit the pulley wheel and then the bottom burst.
A shower of bricks rained down on me I didn't have a hope.
As I lay there bleeding on the ground I let go of the bloody rope.
The barrel now being heavier, it started down once more.
It landed right across me as I lay there on the floor.
It broke three ribs and my left arm and I can only say.
I hope you understand why I am not at work today."
"2242" "Well I've been a Sunday driver noo for many's a happy year
And I've never had my Morris Minor oot o' second gear
I can drive at fifty miles an hour on motorway or track
With me wife up front beside me and her mother in the back
There was me and my daddy and my daddy's mammy
And her sister's Granny and four of her chums
And Auntie Jean
In a crowd of fifty trippers you can always pick me oot
By my \"Don't blame me, I voted Tory\" sticker on the boot
Wi' my bunch of heather stickin' in ma radiator grille
And me stick-on transfer bullet holes and licence for tae kill
There was me and my daddy and my daddy's mammy
And her sister's Granny and four of her chums
And Auntie Peg

And my steering wheel is clad in simulated leopard-skin
Up front fae the drivin' mirror hangs a plastic skeleton
And in the back a dog wi' eyes that flicker off and on!
There was me and my daddy and my daddy's mammy
And her sister's Granny and four of her chums
And Auntie May
I always drive as though my foot was restin' on the brake
And I weave aboot the road just so's ye cannae overtake
I can get ye sae frustrated that ye'll finish up in tears
And the sound of blarin' motor horns is music to my ears!
There was me and my daddy and my daddy's mammy
And her sister's Granny and four of her chums
And Auntie Liz
Now if ye wonder how these weekly trips I can afford
It's because I'm on a stipend from the Scottish Tourist Board
You're supposed tae enjoy the scenery, the finest of it's kind
And that is why I have a convoy followin' behind!
There was me and my daddy and my daddy's mammy
And her sister's Granny and four of her chums
And Auntie Rose
There's just no way of escaping me, no matter how ye seek
For the simple fact that I'm a traffic warden through the week
I'm boostin' my efficiency, and here's my master plan
I'm savin' up my pennies for to buy a Caravan
There was me and my daddy and my daddy's mammy
And her sister's Granny and four of her chums
And Auntie Gertrude
There was me and my daddy and my daddy's mammy

Come now gather now, here where the flowers grow
White is the blossom as the snow on the ben
Hear now, freedom's call, we'll make a solemn vow
Now by the roses o' Prince Charlie

Fight again at Bannockburn yer battleaxe tae wield
Fight wi yer grandsires on Flodden's bloody field
Fight at Culloden, the Bonnie Prince tae shield
Fight by the roses o' Prince Charlie
(Chorus)
Spirits o' the banished, in far an' distant lands
Carved out the new world wi' sweat, blood an' hand
Return now in glory an' on the silver sand
Fight by the roses o' Prince Charlie
(Chorus)
Tak' yer strength fae the green fields that blanket peat
And coal
Ships fae the Clyde have a nation in their hold
The water of life, some men need tae mak' them bold
Black gold and fishes fae the sea, man

Something is wrong? Correct this"
"2244" "Well, the year was 1778
How I wish I was in... now!
When a letter of marque was sent by the king
To the scummiest vessel IÃ¢ÂÂve ever seen
God damn them all
I was told weÃ¢ÂÂd sail the seas
For American gold
WeÃ¢ÂÂd fire no guns, she'd no tears
IÃ¢ÂÂm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of BarrettÃ¢ÂÂs Privateers
Ã¢ÂÂTwas then Ã¢ÂÂSid Barrett cried the town
How I wish I was in... now!
For twenty man, all fisherman who
Would make for him the Antelope crew
God damn them all
I was told weÃ¢ÂÂd sail the seas
For American gold
WeÃ¢ÂÂd fire no guns, she'd no tears
IÃ¢ÂÂm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of BarrettÃ¢ÂÂs Privateers
Now, the AntelopeÃ¢ÂÂs sloop was a sickening sight
I wish I was in... now!
With a list to port and Ã¢ÂÂer sails in rags
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags
God damn them all
I was told weÃ¢ÂÂd sail the seas
For American gold
WeÃ¢ÂÂd fire no guns, she'd no tears
IÃ¢ÂÂm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of BarrettÃ¢ÂÂs Privateers
On the kings birthday we sailed away
I wish I was in... now!
When a great big Yankee hovered in sight
With our cracked four-pounders we made to fight.
God damn them all
I was told weÃ¢ÂÂd sail the seas
For American gold
WeÃ¢ÂÂd fire no guns, she'd no tears
IÃ¢ÂÂm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of BarrettÃ¢ÂÂs Privateers
The Yankee lay low down with gold
I wish I was in Ã¢ÂÂ¦ now!
She was low and fat and loose stays
But to catch her took the Antelope three whole days
God damn them all
I was told weÃ¢ÂÂd sail the seas
For American gold
WeÃ¢ÂÂd fire no guns, she'd no tears
IÃ¢ÂÂm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of BarrettÃ¢ÂÂs Privateers
But at length we stood two cables away
I wish I was inÃ¢ÂÂ¦ now!
Our cracked four-pounders made an awful din
But with one fat ball the YankÃ¢ÂÂ stove us in
God damn them all
I was told weÃ¢ÂÂd sail the seas
For American gold
WeÃ¢ÂÂd fire no guns, she'd no tears
IÃ¢ÂÂm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of BarrettÃ¢ÂÂs Privateers
Well, the Antelope shook and fetched on our side
I wish I was in Ã¢ÂÂ¦ now!
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs
And the main track took away both my legs
God damn them all
I was told weÃ¢ÂÂd sail the seas
For American gold
WeÃ¢ÂÂd fire no guns, she'd no tears
IÃ¢ÂÂm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of BarrettÃ¢ÂÂs Privateers
So, here I lay on my twenty-fifth year
I wish I was inÃ¢ÂÂ¦ now!
Six years since we sailed away
But I just made Halifax yesterday
God damn them all
I was told weÃ¢ÂÂd sail the seas
For American gold
WeÃ¢ÂÂd fire no guns, she'd no tears
IÃ¢ÂÂm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of BarrettÃ¢ÂÂs Privateers
God damn them all
I was told weÃ¢ÂÂd sail the seas
For American gold
WeÃ¢ÂÂd fire no guns, she'd no tears
IÃ¢ÂÂm a broken man on a Halifax pier
Sailed the seas for many a long year
YouÃ¢ÂÂll never find a better man far or near
IÃ¢ÂÂm a last of BarrettÃ¢ÂÂs Privateers"
"2245" "Some poets sing of a noble king,
Or of a sweetheart fair.
Some tell a tale of ships that sail
With treasures rich and rare.
But my humble pen still drifts again
To scenes of long ago;
Across the sea to the Benedy
And the winding river roe.
Right well do I remember now
Those happy childhood days.
And the times I had when just a lad,
On Carn's lovely braes.
And when my mind is thus inclined
No other joys I know,
For my heart remains on the verdant plains
Near the winding river roe.
Benbradagh's crown o'er Dungiven town,
Is still within my view
And the Benedy glen I worshiped then
Still lives in memory too.
The beautiful scene of Cashel Green
Still haunts wherever I go.
And in all my dreams, I see it seems
The winding river roe.
If fortunes smiles on me awhile,
I would cross the sea again,
And all these years of toil and tears
Will be forgotten then.
And when at last my life has passed,
Contentedly I'll go across the sea
To the Benedy
And the winding river roe."
"2246" "The snow it melts the soonest when the winds begin to sing
And the corn it ripens fastest when the frost is setting in
And when the young man tells me that my face he'll soon forget
Before we part I bet a crown, he'd be fain to follow it yet
And the snow it melts the soonest when the winds begin to sing
And the swallow skims without a thought as long as it is spring
But when spring blows and winter goes my love then you'll be free
With all your pride and to follow me where it crossed the stormy sea
And the snows they melt the soonest when the winds begin to sing
And the bee that flew when summer shone in winter he won't sing
And all the flowers in all the land so brightly they may be.
And the snow it melts the soonest when my true love's for me.
So whoever says to me farewell here, no farewell I receive,
For you will leave me at your side, or you kiss and take your leave
And I'll wait here 'til the moorcock calls and the Martin takes his leave
For the snow it melts the soonest when the winds begin to sing."
"2247" "Leaving sweet lovely Derry for fair London town
There is no finer harbour all around can be found
Where the youngsters each evening go down to the shore
And the joy bells are ringing for the maid of Culmore
The first time I saw her she passed me by
And the next time I saw her she bid me goodbye
But the last time I saw her it grieved my heart sore
For she sailed down Loch Foyle and away from Culmore
If I had the power the storms for to rise
I would make the wind blow and I'd darken the skies
I would make the wind blow high and the salt seas to roar
Till the day that my darling sailed away from Culmore
To the back parts of America my love I'll go and see
For it's there I know no-one and no-one knows me
And if I don't find her I'll return home no more
Like a pilgrim I'll wander for the maid of Culmore"
"2248" "She's like the swallow that flies so high
She's like the river that never runs dry
She's like the sunshine on the lee shore
She loves her love and love is no more
Ã¢??Tis out in the meadow this fair maid did go
Picking the lovely primrose
The more she plucked the more she pulled
Until she's got her apron full
She climbed on yonder hill above
To give a rose unto her love
She gave him one, she gave him three
She gave her heart for company
And as they sat on yonder hill
His heart grew hard, so harder still
He has two hearts instead of one
She says, young man what have you done"
"2249" "\"Oh rise up my darling and come with me
I want to go with you and leave this country
To leave my fathers dwelling, this house and the land
So away goes Jamie with his love in his arms
They go over hills and the mountains and glens
Traveling all through the night in the mist in the rain
But her father has followed and has taken his men
And he captured poor Jamie with his love in his arms
Now home she was taken to her room she is bound
While poor Jamie lies on the cold stoney ground
And he knows all the while before the judge he will stand
For the stealing of nothing but his own true love's hand
In the cold hard iron his hands they are bound
Handcuffed like a murderer and tied to the ground
And the goaler tells Jamie \"last night I did hear
That your Lady will hang you or else set you clear\"
The judge says \"this young girl being tender in youth
If Jamie is guilty she will tell the truth\"
Then the radiant beauty before him did stand
\"Oh I'm happy to see you my bold Irish lad\"
But the father cries out \"Lord have pity on me
For the man came to bring disgrace to my family
And he stole my only daughter, all part of his plan
And if you don't hang him I will quit the land\"
But the daughter is crying and begging is she
\"The fault isn't Jamie's the blame lies with me
I forced him to leave and run away with me
And I'll die if I can't save my bold Jamie\"
\"Good Lord he has stole all her jewels and her rings
Gold watches and amber, all my precious things
And it costs me a fortune in thousands of pounds
And I'll take the life of Jamie before I lie in the ground
\"Good Lord I gave them as a token of love
An when we are parted I'll have them removed
But a true lovers token wear on your right hand
And think of me darling when you're in a foreign land\""
"2250" "Kind friends and companions, together combine
And raise up your voices in chorus with mine
Let us drink and be merry, all grief to refrain
For we may and might never all meet here again
[Chorus]
Here's a health to the company and one to my lass
Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass
Let us drink and be merry, all grief to refrain
For we may and might never all meet here again
Here's a health to the wee lass that I love so well
Her style and her beauty, there's none can excel
There's a smile on her countenance as she sits on my knee
Sure there's no one in in this wide world as happy as me
[Chorus]
Our ship lies at harbor, she's ready to dock
I hope she's safe landed without shake or shock
And when we are sailing to the land of the free
I will always remember your kindness to me
I have read this old proverb, I've read it so true
My love is as fair as the bright morning dew
I have read this old proverb, I suppose you have too
So good friends and companions I bid you adieu
[Chorus]"
"2251" "Green grows the laurel, soft falls the dew
Sorry was I love when parting from you
But at our next meeting I hope you'll prove true
And we'll join the green laurel and the violet so blue
I once had a sweetheart but now I have none
He's gone and he's left me to weep and to mourn
He's gone and he's left me for others to see
I'll soon find another far better than he
He passes my window both early and late
And the looks that he gives me would make my heart break
The looks that he gives me a thousand would kill
Though hates and detests me I love that lad still
I wrote him a letter in red rosy lines
He wrote back an answer all twisted and twined
Saying keep your love letters and I'll keep mine
You write to your love and I'll write to mine
Now often I wonder why maidens love men
And often I wonder why young men love them
But from my own knowledge I will have you know
The men are deceivers wherever they go
Green grows the laurel, soft falls the dew
Sorry was I love when parting from you
But at our next meeting I hope you'll prove true
And we'll join the green laurel and the violet so blue"
"2252" "Farewell to old Ireland, the land of my childhood
Which now and forever I am going to leave
Farewell to the shores, where the shamrock is growing
It's the bright spot of beauty and the home of the brave
I'll think on its valleys with fond admiration
Though never again its bright hills will I see
I'm bound for to cross the wide swelling ocean
In search of fame and fortune and of sweet liberty
Our ship at the present lies in Derry harbour
To bear us away across the wide swelling sea
May heaven be her companion and grant her fair breezes
Till we reach the green fields of America
It's hard to be forced from the land that we live in
Our houses and farms all obiged for to sell
To wander along among Indians and strangers
To find some sweet spot where our children might dwell
Our artists, our farmers, our tradesmen are leaving
To seek for employment far over the sea
Where they'll get their riches with care and with industry
There's nothing but hardship at home if you stay
So cheer up your spirits, you lads and you lasses
There's gold for the digging and lots of it, too
A health to the heart that has courage to ramble
Bad luck to the lad or the lass that would rue
We'll call for a bumper of ale, wine and brandy
We'll drink to the health of those far away
Our hearts will all warm at the thought of old Ireland
When we're on the green fields of Americay"
"2253" "Where are you now
And who's by your side
Can't hide for a lifetime
Uncover your eyes
Wake up, in the morning
Share the sunlight shining down on us
You and me
Are these sad days always lost on us
Where am I now
and who's on my side
I'd wait for a lifetime
For you to come back
Wake up, in the evening
Share the moonlight shining down on us
You and me
Are these sad days always lost on us
Can anyone play me another sad song
Cause sad songs remind me of all that we've lost
Can anyone play me another sad song
Cause sad songs remind me of all that we've lost
Wake up, in the morning
Share the sunlight shining down on us
You and me
You and me"
"2254" "My song for you this evening
Is not to make you sad
Nor for adding to the sorrows
Of this troubled northern land
But lately, I've been thinking
And it just won't leave my mind
I'll tell you about two friends one time
Who were both good friends of mine
Isaac, he was Protestant
And Sean was Catholic born
But it never made a difference
For the friendship, it was strong
And sometimes in the evening
When they heard the sound of drums
They said, they won't divide us
We will always be as one
There were roses, roses
There were roses
And the tears of a people ran together
It was on a Sunday morning
When the awful news came 'round
Another killing had been done
Just outside Newry town
We knew that Isaac danced up there
We knew he liked the band
But when we heard that he was dead
We just could not understand
Now fear, it filled the countryside
There was fear in every home
When late at night, a car came
Prowling 'round the Ryan Road
A Catholic would be killed tonight
To even up the score
Oh Christ, it's young Macdonald
They have taken from the door
There were roses, roses
There were roses
And the tears of a people ran together
Isaac was my friend, he cried
He begged them with his tears
But centuries of hatred
Have ears that do not hear
An eye for an eye
That was all that filled their minds
And another eye for another eye
Till everyone was blind
Now I don't know where the moral is
Or where the song should end
But I wonder just how many wars
Are fought between good friends
And those who give the orders
Are not the ones to die
It's Scott and young Macdonald
And the likes of you and I
There were roses, roses
There were roses
And the tears of a people ran together"
"2255" "Turn it inside out so I can see-uh
The part of you that's drifting over me-uh
And when I wake you're--you're never there
And when I sleep you're--you're everywhere
You're everywhere
Just tell me how I got this far
Just tell me why you're here and who you are
'Cause every time I look
You're never there
And every time I sleep
You're always there
'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes it's you I see
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I recognize the way you make me feel
It's hard to think that you might not be real
I sense it now, the water's getting deep
I try to wash the pain away from me
Away from me
'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes it's you I see
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I am not alone
And when I touch your hand
It's then I understand
The beauty that's within
It's now that we begin
You always light my way
I hope there never comes a day
No matter where I go
I always feel you so
'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes it's you I see
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone
'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I catch my breath
It's you I breathe
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone
You're in everyone I see
So tell me
Do you see me?"
"2256" "Blue mountain river, if only for a while
Take me to the river, lay down by your side
The world is full of madness and I find it hard to smile
Take me where you're going and I'll be right by your side
Blue mountain river, comfort me a while
I'll follow down the river, follow you till night
I hasten to your whispers, you dance in time to mine
We'll stay awake together watching the silver in the sky
Blue mountain river, I want to rest a while
You're changing my reflection and the seasons in my mind
Let these days go on forever, I'll leave in my own time
Take me where you're going and I'll be right by your side
Blue mountain river, I went there for a while
I listened for an answer and I found it deep inside
When I'm lost behind the shadows and I want to run and hide
My blue mountain river is there right by my side"
"2257" "After the morning there comes an evening
And after the evening another day
And after a false love there comes a true love
I'd have you listen now to what I say
I swear my love is the finest young man
As fair as any the sun shines on
But how to save him, I do not know it
For he has got a sentence to be hung
As he was marching the streets of Derry
I own he marched up right manfully
Being much more like a commanding officer
Than a man to die upon the gallows tree
\"What keeps my love so long in coming
Oh what detains her so long from me
Or does she think it a shame or scandal
To see me die upon the gallows tree\"
He looked around and he saw her coming
And she was dressed all in woolen fine
The weary steed that my love was riding
It flew more swiftly than the wind
Come down, come down from that cruel gallows
I've got your pardon from the king
And I'll let them see that they dare not hang you
And I'll crown my love with a bunch of green"
"2258" "I wish I was in heaven high
For night and day I just wait and cry
And from my arms he flew one night
To where I cannot find
I wish I had the wings to fly
For in this world he left no sign
But maybe someday he'll bring me back
To where I cannot find
Had I the heart to tell him then
He might have stayed until the end
But maybe someday we'll meet again of the
In where I cannot find"
"2259" "Black is the colour of my true love's hair
Her lips are like a rose so fair
She's got the sweetest face and the gentlest hands
I love the ground whereon she stands
I love my love and well she knows
I love the ground whereon she goes
And how I wish the day would come
When she and I can be as one
Black is the colour of my true love's hair
Her lips are like a rose so fair
She's got the sweetest face and the gentlest hands
I love the ground whereon she stands
I go to the Clyde and mourn and weep
Satisfied I never will sleep
I'll write her a letter, just a few short lines
And suffer death ten thousand times"
"2260" "It being in the springtime and the small birds they were singing
Down by yon shady harbour I carelessly did stray
The thrushes they were warbling, the violets they were charming
To view fond lovers talking, a while I did delay
She said, my dear don't leave me all for another season
Though fortune does be pleasing I'll go along with you
I'll forsake friends and relations and bid this Irish Nation
And to the bonny Bann banks forever I'll bid adieu
He said, my dear don't grieve or yet annoy my patience
You know I love you dearly the more I'm going away
I'm going to a foreign nation to purchase a plantation
To comfort us hereafter all in America
Then after a short while a fortune does be pleasing
\"Twill cause them for to smile at our late going away
We'll be happy as Queen Victoria, all in her greatest glory
We'll be drinking wine and porter, all in America
If you were in your bed lying and thinking on dying
The sight of the lovely Bann banks your sorrow you'd give o'er
Or if were down one hour, down in yon shady bower
Pleasure would surround you, you'd think on death no more
Then fare you well, sweet Craigie Hill, where often times I've roved
I never thought my childhood days I'd part you any more
Now we're sailing on the ocean for honour and promotion
And the bonny boats are sailing, way down by Doorin shore"
"2261" "The leaves fall from the trees like gold
And I tell you that I love you so
The river sings, it's time to go
What lies ahead we'll never know
And summer brings sweet memories
When we danced all night on the dusty streets
With an angel watching over me
Your love has brought me to my knees
[Chorus]
Well I've loved you and I wish it so,
Wherever you decide to go
Yes I've loved you well I wish it so,
Wherever you decide to go
We kissed under the tired moon
And the stars shone down for me and you
We listen for the cock to crow
Come break of day you had to go
[Chorus]
I didn't want to let you leave
I didn't wanna tell you no
'Cause I know how to make you feel
And I don't wanna let you go
I didn't want to let you leave
I didn't wanna tell you no
'Cause I know how to make you feel
And I don't wanna let you go
Laa la la la ohh
La la la la
[Chorus]
Yes I've loved you well I wish it so,
Wherever you decide to go
Yes I've loved you well I told you so
Wherever you decide to go
I've loved you well
Wherever you decide to go
I've loved you well
Winter brings sweet melodies
Come back to me
Winter brings sweet melodies
Come back to me
Winter brings sweet melodies
Come back to me
Winter brings sweet melodies
Come back to me"
"2262" "I'm falling like a star, and I'm holding on for dear life
I'm about to reach the ground
I'm coming home to Earth
I've reached my town
And they said that you couldn't sit on a cloud, cause you'd fall right through
Well how is it then, that I managed to?
And how did I say what I just said to you?
Am I thinking out loud, did you even ask me to?
I'm falling like a star, and I'm holding on for dear life
I'm about to reach the ground
I'm coming home to Earth
I've reached my town
And the streets are empty how, but for the wrong reasons
They've all gone and left me alone
And they left with a vengance, and they talk of their experience
And they'll try and convince me, to join them
Holy, Holy
Holy is the only word I know these days
Holy, Holy
Holy is the only word I know these days
Those flowers have never experienced anything like this before
They've been picked from their wilderness, put in a jar
Now they're feeling the heat of this room
And I'm falling like a star, and I'm holding on for dear life
I'm about to reach the ground
I'm coming home to Earth
I've reached my town
Falling like a star
I only came down for a day, I didn't want to stay
Falling like a star
I only came down for a day, I didn't want to stay"
"2263" "I will not forget all the things, I haven't said yet
And so I'll wait
Like water thrown on water, its always hard to tell
Just where is ends
Getting ready to be strung, there is sweetness to
Every blow
Broken bridges, wish I could lie down
Freedom angels come and save me now
So I lost my fortune then found it in a glen
Trees and branches led me straight to him
Oh my love, freedom caused us shame
On the breeze, your words call again
Will we learn to wait until tomorrow
Not knowing where we'll go
Broken bridgesm selfish now it sounds
Thirsty whispers told me to find out
Well I tried to stay until the summer came
Winter madness running through my veins
Oh my love, freedom caused us shame
On the breeze you words call again
Will we learn to wait until tomorrow
Not knowing where we'll go
You say
Words don't mean a thing
You say
Words don't mean a thing"
"2264" "When all is said and done
You're still a lucky one
And I've lost out again this time
You said that we were strong
Said that we'd go on and on
Do you see that you were wrong this time?
Now I want to tell you
[Chorus]
If you wanted to break me
If you wanted to see me falling
I'll make it easy for you
No, you won't have to try
Really think you should know that
Come the morning light
There'll be no-one left to fight
You say I'm not to blame
Things don't often go your way
Well maybe you were wrong this time
'Cause from where I'm standing now
It doesn't matter any how
We've lost too many friends this time
Now I need to tell you
[Chorus]
When darkness follows you home at night
And all the voices drown you out
This world is turning us inside out
Do you believe it is worth the fight
[Chorus]"
"2265" "This is really not my home
Oh where are you my lovely Johnny?
I'm afraid and all alone
There is no peace for me
I'm sitting in the stranger's room
Playing at the stranger's table
Shining empty like the moon
There is no peace for me
Chorus:
But in the darkness struggle cold
I think about a garden valley
Gentle as the leaves unfold
Singing out across the bay
Distant and so far away
There is no peace for me
I'm blinded by your city lights
I wander through these fearful places
The colours fade to black and white
There is no peace for me
And these are not the friends I know
These are not their smiling faces
A desert that no-one should know
There is no peace for me
Chorus
Now I know and feel it well
Poor immigrants deep sunken feeling
Standing at the gates of Hell
There is no peace for me
Burned out by their master's greed
Cruel exile transportation
Robbed of every love and need
There is no peace for me
Chorus"
"2266" "If you want me I'll be at your door
And if you need me I'll be by your side
'cause every day is a long winding road
And I'll always be here don't you know
I wonder why, I wonder why, I wonder why
I always try, I wonder why, I wonder why
[Chorus]
Every time I look at you I feel the blues
Can't hide the pain inside
No-one ever told me that my heart could break a hundred-thousand times
Never in a million years I thought the tears could break a heart of stone
If you need me let me know
Well, if you've got no-one to give your heart to
And if you've searched and you can't find the truth
When they tell you this time to let go
Well, I'll always be here - don't you know
I wonder why, I wonder why, I wonder why
[Chorus]
Oh, nobody told me bout the wind and the trees
And the summer breeze and
You carry the weight of the world on your shoulders
And the light is slipping through
And I've seen the sun catching your eye
Like the moon in the sky
Every time I look at you I feel the blues
Can't hide the pain inside
No-one ever told me that my heart could break a hundred-thousand times
And though you've never asked me to believe its true
I've loved you from the start
Oh I've got to find a way to mend today
These wings that need to fly
No-one ever told me that my heart could break a hundred-thousand times
Never in a million years I thought the tears could break a heart of stone
If you need me let me know"
"2267" "As the lonesome scenes of winter in stormy winds do blow
Clouds around the centre inclined to frost and snow
You're the boy that I have chosen to be my only dear
Your scornful heart is frozen and drifted far I fear
One night I went to see my love, but he proved most scornfully
I asked him if he'd marry me, but he would not marry me
The night it is far spent, my love, it's near the break of day
And I'm waiting for your answer, my dear, what do you say?
I can but plainly tell you, I'll lead a single life
I never thought it fitting that you should be my wife
So take a civil answer and for yourself provide
I have another sweetheart and you I have laid aside
Now my mind is changing that old love for the new
This wide and lonesome valley I mean to ramble through'
In search of someone handsome that might my fancy fill
That world is wide and lonesome, if he don't another will"
"2268" "In a land of O'Cahan where bleak mountains rise
O'er those brown ridgy tops now the dusky clouds fly
Deep sunk in a valley a wild flower did grow
And her name was Finvola, the Gem of the Roe
For the Isles of Abunde appeared to out view
A youth clad in tartan, it's strange but it's true
With a star on his breast and unstrung was his bow
And he sighed for Finvola the Gem of the Roe
The Gem of the Roe, the Gem of the Roe
And he sighed for Finvola
The Gem of the Roe
To the grey shores of Alba his bride he did bear
But short were the fond years these lovers did share
For thrice on the hillside the Banshee cried low
Twas the death of Finvola the Gem of the Roe
The Gem of the Roe, the Gem of the Roe
Twas the death of Finvola
The Gem of the Roe
No more up the streamlet her maidens will hie
For wan the pale cheek and bedimmed the blue eye
In silent affliction our sorrows will flow
Since gone is Finvola the Gem of the Roe
The Gem of the Roe, the Gem of the Roe
Since gone is Finvola
The Gem of the Roe"
"2269" "Days, turning from red to green
It's hard to believe that spring
Is here so soon and I've been gone so long.
Keep, sending your letters on
Memories of whom are still
Haunting my days and I am losing my way
[Chorus]
High tide
Changing moods
Familiar faces I know
High tide
Changing light
Familiar places I go
Keep playing our favorite song
'Cause sometimes I sing it so loud
And pray that you might hear
And sing along
Days, turning from sweet to dry
Memories of whom are still
Haunting my days, I wait
For your reply"
"2270" "Through the mist my ship has sailed, leaving me behind
All things left unsaid, that were in my mind
When I stood on this deck, strange things I saw
Strange they have vanished now
I'm standing on the shore
Sandy hills all around, nothing standing clear
Softly light is falling through, time was never here
When I stood on this deck, stranges things I saw
STRANGE THEY HAVE VANISHED NOW
I'm standing on the shore
Headlands fading out of sight, horizons disappear
Hazy shores and silent seas, nothing DO I fear
Air and water, grass and sand, merging into one
In the silence of the mist, I am still alone
When I stood on this deck, strange things I saw
Strange they have vanished now
I'm standing on the shore
Standing on the shore"
"2271" "Oh father, dear father,
you've done to me much wrong,
You've gone and got me married to a boy
who is too young.
For he is only 16 years and I am 21,
Oh my darling boy is young but he's growing.
Oh daughter, dear daughter,
it's you who have done wrong,
For you and he together have gone and got a son,
And he must have a father when I am dead and gone,
Oh your darling boy is young but he's growing.
One day as I was walking down by the college wall
I saw the young men they were playing football,
My true love was there, he was the finest of them all,
My darling boy is young but he's growing.
Another day I was walking down by the college wall,
I saw the pusher, he was making his call,
My true love was there, he was the palest of them all,
Oh the dealer put an end to his growing.
At the age of sixteen years he was a married man,
And at the age of seventeen, the father of a son,
the grass grew over him,
The dealer put an end to his growing.
Oh the Springtime is past
and the Summer's coming on,
It's earring, beads and bangles the young girls
have put on,
Once I had a true love but now I have got none,
But I 'll watch over his son while he's growing."
"2272" "As I was a'walking one evening of late
Where fragrant fine flowers the fields decorate
I carelessly rambled where I did not know
By the fair crystal fountain that falls in Glencoe
And on her who the prize on Mount Ider was won
Then approached me a lassy as bright as the sun
And the ribbon and the tartan around her did flow
That welcomed young Donald the pride of Glencoe
Said I, my fine creature, your charming sweet smile
And your comely fine features my heart has beguiled
And with your kind affection on me you'll bestow
I'll bless the happy hour we met in Glencoe
Kind Sir, she made answer, your love I'll disdain
For I have a young sweetheart and Donald by name
And he went to the wars about ten years ago
And a maid I remain 'till he returns to Glencoe
Ah, perhaps your young Donald regards not your name
And has placed his affection on some foreign dame
He may have forgotten for all that you know
That bonny young creature he left in Glencoe
From his promise my Donald he'd never depart
For love, truth and honour stand firm in his heart
And if I never see him, then single I'll go
And mourn for my Donald the pride of Glencoe
Then seeing her constance he drew out a glove
Which in parting she gave him in token of love
She clung to his arms and tears down did flow
Ah, you're welcome my Donald the pride of Glencoe
Come cheer up my Flora your sorrows are o'er
And since we have met love we'll never part more
And the loud blast of battle, far distant may blow
Whilst in peace and contentment we'll live in Glencoe"
"2273" "Oh draw near each young lover,
Give ear to my story
That bears my sad, mournful tale.
Come join me in chorus
And lend me your pity,
While I my misfortune bewail.
The grief my poor heart
No tongue can disclose.
My cheeks are now pale,
They once bloomed like the rose.
And it's all for a young man,
Whom I do suppose
Is now far from sweet Erin the Green.
Now when were children
We walked out together
Along the green meadows sweet.
And although we were childish
We loved one another
Whilst gathering the wild berries sweet.
It was to sweet Garvagh where we were sent to school,
He was first in his class
And correct in each rule.
And I cheerfully walked home by Kilnacoole
With the flower of sweet Erin the Green.
Oh his head on my breast
And he used to repose
At each evening under the shade.
A song in my praises my darling composed
And he styled me the cool Derry maid.
At the time I denied him I'd die for his sake,
It was little I thought my denial he'd take.
Oh, but my own misfortune
I made a mistake
When he left me on Erin the Green."
"2274" "When you feel so tired trying
When you ask and no-one knows
When your heart is tired fighting
When you feel like letting go
Take this love I've freely given
Take this dream I'm wishing for
[Chorus]
How long is forever
If I can't see you anymore
I'll miss you most whenever October winds begin to blow
Well these days have lost their meaning
And these nights can feel so cold
Endless days not ever knowing
What is all this suffering for
Take these words \"so sad to leaveing\"
Take this breath I breathe that's warm
Take these tears so softly falling
Take these love forever more
[Chorus]"
"2275" "One night as I lay slumbering in my silent bed alone
Some reckless thoughts came to my mind which caused me for to roam
To leave my native country and the wee girl I do adore
So I thought it fit to take a trip, strange lands for to explore
Now the night before I went away I was walking over Brockagh Hill
When I met my darling on the road and her eyes with tears did fill
\"Stay you at home dear John\" she said \"and do not go away
For I'll have none to comfort me when you are on the sea\"
Well I took her by the lily white hand and I held her hard and fast
Saying \"adieu to you my darling for my ship it lies in Belfast
But if you prove loyal sure I'll prove true for you know that I'm well inclined\"
So we kissed goodbye and parted and I left my girl behind
And when we landed in Greenock sure the people all gathered around
And they said I was a rakish lad come to put their harvest down
They told me to return again and never more be seen
So without delay I sailed away for Ireland's lovely green
Sure when Mary heard that John was home her heart did beat with joy
Saying \"come into my arms\" she cried \"you're my darling lovely boy\"
Saying \"come into my arms\" she cried \"of you I have thought great and long
And let them all say as they will, our wedding will now go on
And let them all say as they as they will"
"2276" "You're the one who's nearly breaking my heart,
Had your chance, you just threw it all away.
Living in a world that you could never be a part of,
And there's time to walk away.
You can't stay, no you can't stay.
You're no loser, there's still time to ride that train
and you must be on your way tonight.
Think a new right through, you're a man in the rain.
What's the use in hanging round these walls?
Lamps are burning, but nobody's at home.
There's a new day dawning as a cold rain falls,
And now's the time to walk alone.
You can't stay, no you can't stay.
You're no loser, there's still time to ride that train
and you must be on your way tonight.
Think a new right through, you're a man in the rain.
How's it feel when there's time to remember?
Branches bare, like the trees in November.
Had it all, threw it all away.
Now's the time to walk away.
You can't stay, no you can't stay.
You're no loser, there's still time to ride that train
and you must be on your way tonight.
Think a new right through, you're a man in the rain.
How's it feel when there's time to remember?
Branches bare, like the trees in November.
How's it feel when there's time to remember?
Branches bare, like the trees in November.

Threw it all away.
You can't stay, no you can't stay.
You're no loser, there's still time to ride that train

Think a new right through, you're a man in the rain.
Threw it all away. Threw it all away.
Now's the time to walk away.

"2277" "Dear thoughts are in my mind and my soul it soars enchanted
As I hear the sweet lark sing in the clear air of the day
For a tender beaming smile to my hope has been granted
And tomorrow he shall hear all my fond heart longs to say
I will tell him all my love, all my soul's pure adoration
And I know he will hear my voice and he will not answer me nay
It is this that gives my soul all it's joyous elation
As I hear the sweet lark sing in the clear air of the day"
"2278" "I am a youth that's inclined to ramble
To some foreign country, I mean to steer
I am loath to part from my friends and comrades
And my dear sweetheart, whom I loved dear
But there's one of those, I do most admire
One her, I'll think when I'm far away
For since fates decreed, I am resolved to part her
And try my fortune in Americay
So farewell, darling, I must leave you
I place great dependence on your constancy
That no other young man may gain your favor
Or change your mind when I am over the sea
For although the seas do separate us
And in between us, they do rise and fall
If fortune favors me you'll find your Jamie
Returning homeward from Americay
Oh Jamie dear, do you remember
When I sat with you for many the hour
And my young fancy away was carried
And the bees hummed around on each opening flower
But when you're crossing the western ocean
The maid that loved you, you'll never mind eva'
And you'll scarce ever think upon the maids of Erin
For you'll find strange sweethearts in America
Oh Mary dear, I don't dissemble
For to all other fair maids, I'll prove untrue
And if you think that these are false promise
I'll leave these vows as a pledge to you
That what I have may prove unsuccessful
And fortune prove to me a slippery ball
That a favoring gale it may never blow on me
If forsake you in America
And to conclude and to end these verses
May God protect this young female fair
And keep her from every wild embarrassment
And of, my darling, take the greatest care
For she's slow to anger and of kind disposition
And her cheeks like roses in June do blow
In my nightly slumbers when ever I think on her
I could court her vision in America"
"2279" "Come all you gallant poachers who ramble void of care,
Who wander out on a moonlit night with your dog, your gun and snare,
The hare and lofty pheasant you have at your command,
Not thinking of your long career spend on Van Dieman's land.
Poor Thomas Brown from Nenagh town, John Murphy and Poor Joe,
Where three determined poachers, the country well does know,
By the keepers of the land, one night, at last they were trepanned,
And for fourteen years transported unto Van Dieman's Land.
The first day that we landed upon that fatal shore,
The planters gathered around us, they might be twenty score,
They ranked us off like horses and sold us out of hand,
They yoked us to a plough, brave boys, to plough Van Dieman's Land.
Often when I slumber, I have a pleasant dream,
I 'm lying on the cold green grass down by your purling stream,
Oh, wondering through the maid of fair with my sweetheart by the hand,
Then I awaken broken-hearted upon Van Dieman's Land."

I'll try to love you tenderly

Loving you comes easily
I'll try to love
I try to love you tenderly
Take my hand and don't look back
Take my hand and don't look back
We'll take a ride on the railroad track
Take my hand
Take my hand and don't look back
We'll sing a song to the cities beat
Where the white sheets hang above the dusty streets
The songs we sing sound so sweet
We'll sing a song to the city's beat
I can tell that you need your sleep
I can tell that you need your sleep
We've been running round these lonely street
I can tell
I can tell that you need your sleep
How much time do you think we got
How much time do you think we got
We had a little now we hope for lots
Tell me
How much time do you think we got
Lets raise a glass to the ones we love
Raise a glass to the ones we love
And spare a thought for the ones above

"2281" "Some walls are made of stone
Some times we build our own
Some walls will stand for years
Some wash away with tears
Some walls are lined with gold
Some hearts stay safe and cold
Some walls are made of doubt
Holding in and keeping out
[Chorus]
If there's any hope for love at all
Some walls must fall
Some walls are built on pride
Some keep a child inside
Some walls are made in fear
That love let go will disappear

How will you ever know what might be found
Until you let the walls come tumbling down

"2282" "Bonny, bonny was my seat in the red rosy yard
And bonny was my ship in the town of Ballynagard
Shade and shelter was for me till I began to fail
You all may guess now my distress lies near the Nightingale
Grief and woe that I must go to fight for England's King
I neither know his friend or foe, and war's a cruel thing
The nightingale is near at hand, my time at home is brief
And Carey's steams and mountain land I part with bitter grief
No more I'll walk the golden hills with Nancy by my side
Or dream along the sun bright rills, or view my land with pride
We sail away at dawn of day, the sails are ready set
When old Benmore I see no more, I'll sigh with deep regret
Now all must change and I must range across the ocean wide
Our ship she may in Biscay's Bay lie low beneath the tide
If I should fall by cannon ball, or sink beneath the sea
Good people all, a tear let fall and mourn for mine and me"

And blinded by the tears that fell like water
No more to see the bright morning star
The streets of dreams never looked this lonely
The streets of dreams never felt this hard
And I heard my voice barely of a whisper
As the clouds denied the bright morning star
Sometimes this life is no more than a moment
And sometimes this light is lost unto the dark
But courage hears the sound of dawn approaching
And each our own, bright morning star
I woke to find every window open
I woke to find the heavy door jar
And I walked outside and stood upon the hilltop
And gazed one small bright morning star
I walked outside and every bird was singing

I'm a fighter bird
I'm a harrier hawk
A wild flock
I keep time by the city clock
When the moon is steady
I'll find you
I'm not lucky
And I'm not scared
There could be a goldmine anywhere
Anyone that I might want in this world
They're asleep in the arms of another girl
Who will they be when the lights come up?
Everyone that I ever loved in my life
Now calls somebody else their wife
Who am I to you?
Get up, get up
Get it together and climb on up
To the top of the tree
I'm an owl now, a lonely owl
Who, who, where, what, why, when
How the hell'd I get this far without you?
Pull my feathers on by one
Put'em in your pocket when I'm gone
Anyone that I might want in this world
They're asleep in the arms of another girl
Who will they be when the lights come up?
Everyone that I ever loved in my life
Now calls somebody else their wife
Who am I to you?
Who am I to you?
Am I just anyone?
Am I the only one?
Who am I to you?
Am I just anyone?
Am I the only one?
Come on, come on
Put me back together, let me soldier on
I'm the king of it all
I'm a little wren
I'm happiest when I hitch a ride on the wing of a friend
Looking down on everything then
When the road gets weary love
Remember who I'm dreaming of"

That true lovers must endure

It brings me so much joy in my heart.
Takes me back to the very first time when you said you wanted us to stop.
Lady I apologize, for all those lonely days and
Those restless nights without me by your side.
And when you cry, cause my insensitivity
Didn't see the signs, when all I wanted was to make you smile.
She was the bestest, top of me checklist,
Love, time, dedication well invested.
So this for mommy loves so dear, and you can't get no satisfaction,
No longer here with me. But it was only meant to set your heart free,
Cause what me offered you would not let us be.
Can't believe that our reality is just a memory.
Every time I see that smile on your face it brings me so much joy in my heart.
Takes me back to the very first time when you said you wanted us to stop.
Lady I apologize, for all those lonely days
And those restless nights without me by your side.
And when you cry, cause my insensitivity didn't see the signs,
When all I wanted was to make you smile.
All I wanted, all I wanted. Lady I apologize,
For all those lonely days and those restless nights without me by your side.
And when you cry, cause my insensitivity didn't see the signs,
When all I wanted was to make you smile."

She knows all the rocks I've been crawling under
She knows all the places I can be found
She knows her way around
My baby loves me
Despite the ugly words I throw her way
And she still wins every fight
No matter if she's right
She sees right through me every time
Oh she knows all the roads I am prone to wander
She knows all the rocks I've been crawling under
She knows all the places I can be found
She knows her way around
I wouldn't have it another way
She calms my fears and keeps me safe
When someone gets you it gets you sane
It's good to know that I am known
She knows all the roads I am prone to wander
She knows all the rocks I've been crawling under
She knows all the places I can be found

there is a crowd around i can feel it breathe
more than a thousand souls out in the night
i get so blinded i can see
smoke is rising from the fire that burns
sky is purple and the water rise
people talking quiet as they start to learn
to see with their own eyes
their lives and our lives different as any other
my pain is your pain tell me, do you want to go under?
you will feel it when the night starts burning
feet shuffle on that day
when we're going to find what we're going to be fighting
come again
you will feel it when the night starts burning
makes you want to stay
light will fill your eyes
we got the seeds of life
hidden in our hands
blinded by ourselves though can't you see that
we've got the seeds of life do you understand?
and hear the calling
you've got love though
love we got inside
it's time to open our eyes and really wonder
and really wonder
if it's enough for all we need in life
can you take me back, can you take me back?"

Yeah we hide from the next day
Cos we know we know that I,
in the end I really can't stay
Pleasure & pain are both the same and love is just a losing game
Wanting to give it all but 'fraid to lose it if it falls apart
We hold each other, but we hold back
Yeah we enclose each other, then we step back
I can see it in your eyes, you need to hold on to your life
Not run away in my dreams of paradise
You're wise, you say that I'm
A Butterfly Man, I'm just a Butterfly Man
Today I'm yours but tomorrow when I'm gone, you'll understand
Butterfly Man, I'm just a Butterfly Man
Holding me mama can't you see's like a hand full of sand
So now before I go away
If I could seal your heart
Keep inside the feelings of today, I'd be
Keeping the fire burning til the moment I return to see you
But the only problem is I cannot promise anything
We hold each other, but we hold back
Yeah we enclose each other, then we step back
I can see it in your eyes, you need to hold on to your life
Not run away in my dreams of paradise
You're wise, you say that I'm

waiting for the sun to rise
I get the feeling that I'm never gonna get my mind
back and I don't mind my feet are on the ceiling
and my big fat juicy heart is bleeding.
Blood's a runnin like the Nile,
down the hall
you start to cry and drop the knife
as I begin to crawl
towards the piano
you're still standing in the door
tell me I'm dying baby, Yeah, I know.
Now you look like an angel with the mercy of love.
To pure to be from below to wicked to be from above.
You come over
so I can feel your heartbeat inside your chest
give me a kiss that tastes (like) cheap
wine and cigarettes.
And the red blood's still spreading everywhere, it's in your pretty little hands and it's in your black hair.
Things go black
and then we're in a place so serene,
swimming in a deep blue canyon mountain stream. Out of the water sitting looking in each other's eyes
your rusty wet lips and brown skin look so nice.
Then a feeling, a vision,
I never had before like I was you & you were me
and we were sitting on heavens floor.
And I still see it baby,
even though the time,
it takes, is weighing on me
Hey hey, mama hey hey

I can't feel no pain,
You are the need,
I can't feel nothing but memories,
Chasing the beast,
So where are you now,
I'm ready to feed,
To feed inside you,
Sleep in the clouds,
And dream, still shining down on me,
And pieces underneath,
Cause half of me is gone,
We are the blood,
Half of me is gone,
We are the bone,
Half of me is gone,
We are the floor,
Half of me is gone,
We are complete, so we are complete,
I'll be your cuts,
And you'll be my mandolin,
You took the purest part of me,
Follow me, you and me,
You made me my own worst enemy,
Your own worst enemy,
Six billion followers, follow me,
You made me my own worst enemy,
Cause we are the blood,
And we are the bone,
And we are the flesh,
Baby you and me,
You may find me excreting hormones,
Directly into your circulatory system,
Delivering oxygen, reaching,
Every cell, every cell,
Cause half of me is gone,
I'm inside you,
Half of me is gone,
I'm inside you,
Half of me is gone,
Oh feed me, feed me, baby,
Half of me is gone,
Woah oh!
Cause we are the blood (baby please wake up),
We are the flesh,
And we are the bones (baby please wait for me now),
Yeah you're all of me,
We are the blood,
We are the flesh,
We are the bone,
Yeah you're all of me,
Follow me, follow me, follow me,
Yeah you're all of me."

LIKE SAND
The gulls used to cry in the garbage dump.
We were smiling with you.
The bombs used to drop in the city every night.
We used to make love without stopping.
Now don't be so cruel.
Don't go away like yesterday, yesterday.
Let me hug, let me be wrapped around your feet.
Don't crush(mash) me like sand.
The fall(autumn) used to drip on our drop.
We used to turn yellow with you

My parasites will eat your will away.
No sacred ground, you'll walk for days....

I want you....
The way you was....Another soul to steal....

I breathed life into you....
Gave you what you need...
You're such a clich...

I've already lost everything I had....(I've never had nothing)...

Become the legions...Not easily replaced.....

They tell me open...and no one hears me scream....
I am falling apart....Prescriptions running too low...
I can't close the gate....My eyes are changing....

It's better to leave broke in this disease.
It Kills..(I suffocate)..Everything I try to be.
Leaves me empty...
Leaking gasoline.
Even though she wants me,
I'll take the morphine so I can't feel anything.

Like bridges with gaps that collapse and die?
Leaving me open, injecting poison...
Be still my beating heart....

Or is it something you earn like street cred?

From every persons fucking point of view.

I saw a girl with pretty eyes, but I know deep inside,
they're all hollow lies. Just like FRIENDS.

Pretend to love you to the end and turn you out.

When our lips meet...I put the world aside, I put the world so far behind.....
Listen here, you don't have to say a word to me! I understand so perfectly!
So clear in my mind, when our lips meet I'm running all across the light!
I'm working my way to you, and I'm loving my way to you!
I keep feeling everything as the world runs around me and I can feel my heart breathe!
While I'm looking in her eyes seeing the light punch in the corner of eyes...and die...
Feel the butterflies move from the left to the right and switch sides...
We sway in the night time looking in stars eyes...
And I'm feeling everything move rotating around you!

Where do go? Where do you run when everything is gone...
Never wanted you to be so mad at me!
I am only trying...
To be something I'm not...(for you to believe in me)
I never wanted you to see lonely...

My blood soaks into the waters...
Little lies, stop fucking with me!
I NEED to feel sick (I love to be sick). I NEED to fall in LOVE.
(I love to be sick)
I NEED to waste my days....
For me to live....
Gotta love the drugs, they make me feel so numb.
Love the drugs, the way they make me feel I'm loved.
Gotta love the drugs...
(I'm not so uptight too get high when I need, a fix)
They make me feel so numb.
Love the drugs, they make me feel so numb.

castles, lands, men that today are yours

Lovely girl facing life

"2582" "Iste mundus furibundus
falsa praestat gaudia
quia fluunt et decurrunt

fugit transit velut umbra

with talons dirty of earth
I've pulled up, lacerated,
I've moulded me like mud

I've modulated me in the deep slow flowing
of the underground seasons
I've taken shape like a shrub dilating my limbs,
I've disentangled from the womb of the earth like
a wild weed
I rise primigenial livid daughter of creation
I rise primigenial livid daughter of creation"

I do it exceptionally well
I do it that it feels like hell
I do it that it seems real
I guess you could say I've a call
It's easy enough to do it in a cell
It's easy enough to do it and stay put
It's theatrical, beware !
Herr God, Herr Lucifer beware !
Out of the ash I'll rise with my black hair
and I'll eat men like air
Out of the ash I'll rise with my black hair
Herr God, Herr Lucifer beware!
Out of the ash I'll rise with my black hair

Every day of that July
But now that's all I have left
Just thirty-one pages of Caroline
I waited all that time for you
To write me back, to write a new

Just hoped my Caroline was safe
And just as I had always feared
Your precious words they disappeared

Child of mine, you are the break of dawn
And the brightest star I will ever know
Love's lasting light comes shining on and on
From this mother's heart as I watch you grow
There is a road and that road is all your own
But we are here, you need not walk alone
To face, not fear each coming new unknown
Is the way to lift your wings

And the greatest gift I will ever know

There is but one that belongs to you
So let it grow and it will thrive on love
For it is love that sees us through"

I was raised where the mountains are old
Their springtime waters came dancing down
And I remember the tales they told
The whistling ways of my younger days
Too quickly have faded on by
But all of their memories linger on
Like the light in a fading sky
River, take me along in your sunshine, sing me a song
Ever moving and winding and free
You rolling old river, you changing old river
Let's you and me, river, run down to the sea
I've been to the city and back again
I've been moved by some things that I've learned
Met a lot of good people and I've called them friends
Felt the change when the seasons turned
I've heard all the songs that the children sing
And listened to love's melodies
I've felt my own music within me rise
Like the wind in the autumn trees
River, take me along in your sunshine, sing me a song
Ever moving and winding and free
You rolling old river, you changing old river
Let's you and me, river, run down to the sea
Someday when the flowers are blooming still
Someday when the grass is still green
My rolling waters will round the bend
And flow into the open sea
So, here's to the rainbow that's followed me here
And here's to the friends that I know
And here's to the song that's within me now
I will sing it wherever I go
River, take me along in your sunshine, sing me a song
Ever moving and winding and free
You rolling old river, you changing old river
Let's you and me, river, run down to the sea"

Some sing low, some sing higher
Some sing out loud on the telephone wires
And some just clap their hands, or paws, or anything they got now

Where the bullfrog croaks and the hippopotamus
Moans and groans with a big t'do
And the old cow just goes moo
The dogs and the cats they take up the middle
While the honeybee hums and the cricket fiddles
The donkey brays and the pony neighs
And the old coyote howls
All God's critters got a place in the choir
Some sing low, some sing higher
Some sing out loud on the telephone wires
And some just clap their hands, or paws, or anything they got now
Listen to the top where the little birds sing
On the melodies with the high notes ringing
The hoot owl hollers over everything
And the jaybird disagrees
Singin' in the night time, singing in the day
The little duck quacks, then he's on his way
The 'possum ain't got much to say
And the porcupine talks to himself
All God's critters got a place in the choir
Some sing low, some sing higher
Some sing out loud on the telephone wires
And some just clap their hands, or paws, or anything they got now
It's a simple song of living sung everywhere
By the ox and the fox and the grizzly gear
The grumpy alligator the the hawk above
The sly raccoon and the turtle dove
All God's critters got a place in the choir
Some sing low, some sing higher
Some sing out loud on the telephone wires
And some just clap their hands, or paws, or anything they got now

Et la bitume, entre le beton et l'asphalte
Et qui ne sauront peut etre jamais
Que la terre etait un jardin
Il y avait un jardin qu'on appellait la terre
Il brillait au soleil comme un fruit defendu
Non ce n'etait pas le paradis ni l'enfer
Ni rien de deja vu ou deja entendu
Il y avait un jardin, une maison, des arbres
Avec un lit de mousse pour y faire l'amour
Et un petit ruisseau roulant sans une vague
Venait le rafraichir et poursuivant son cours
Il y avait un jardin, qu'on appelait la terre
Il etait assez grand pour des milliers d'enfants
Ik etait habite jadis par nos grand-peres
Qui le tenaient eux-memes de leurs grand-parents"

Came to me on a rainy afternoon
And there'd been summer love
Love I trusted far too well, got away and winter's spell
Had broke my heart and left me all alone
And looking for a home to rest my weary heart
For just a while
Then I found it in the smile of a boy
A little boy with midnight in his hair
And promise in his eyes of days and nights still yet to be
Days and nights he'd cling to me
For I am winter's lady and he is winter's child
Though there be summers yet
And the smell of pine comes crying to my heart
Still my joy and my security will lie beside the boy of less impurity
The little boy with midnight in his hair
And diamonds in his eyes
Diamonds made of trust and love for me
And gleaming at me all the afternoon"

We're drowning in their gravy spills

It's delicate confronting these priests of the golden bull
They preach from the pulpit of the bottom line
Their minds rustle with million dollar bills
You say Silver burns a hole in your pocket
And Gold burns a hole in your soul
Well, uranium burns a hole in forever
It just gets out of control
There was a crooked man who walked a crooked mile
He raised a crooked sixpence to hide a crooked style
He won a crooked vote and smiled a crooked smile

But I was up there in the air
while you were over here
with both feet on the ground
Who'd've ever thought it
that it shoulda been you and me
Got to find a way to show it
This effect you have on me
When I think about what I missed
I wish I coulda been your girl
And when I think about all I've lost
I could never count the cost
Cause of what we've got for free
And now it's later,
maybe better late than never
I don't know
But here you are with me
Dance Me Around again
Hold me like it's never gonna end
Finally I've found
somebody who's always been a friend
When I think about what I missed
I wish I coulda been your girl."
"2672" "I'll tell you a story and it's a true one and I'll tell it like you understand
And I ain't gonna talk like some history maid.
I look out and I see a land.
Young and lovely. Hard and strong
For fifty thousand years we've danced her praises.
Prayed our thanks and we've just begun. Yes, Yes
Yes this is my country.
Young and growing.
Free and flowing. See to see.
Yes, this is my country.
Ripe and bearing miracles
in ever pond and tree.
Her spirit walks the high country.
She's giving free wild samples.
And setting an example how to give.
Yes this is my country
Retching and turning
She is like a baby learning how to live
i can stand upon a hill at dawn
Look all around me.
Feel her surround me.
Soldier blue
Can't you see her life has just begun
Beating inside us. Telling us she's here to guide us.
Soldier blue, Soldier blue, Soldier blue.
Can't you see that there's another way to love her.
This is my country
And I sprang from her
And I'm learning how to count upon her.
Tall trees and the corn is high country.
I guess I love her.
And I'm learning how to take care of her
When the news stories get me down
I take a drink of freedom to think of
North America from toe to crown
It's never long before
I know just why I belong here
Soldier Blue, Soldier Blue
Can't you see that there's another way to love her"

And here we'll stay
Until it's time for you to go
Yes, we're diff'rent worlds apart
We're not the same
We laughed and played
At the start like in a game
You could have stayed
Outside my heart
But in you came
And here you'll stay
Until it's time for you to go
Don't ask why,
Don't ask how
Don't ask forever,
Love me now
This love of mine
Had no beginning
It has no end
I was an oak,
Now I'm a willow
Now I can bend
And tho' I'll never
In my life see you again
I still stay
Until it's time for you to go"

Or a king if God wills
But I'm on my way home

I done right I done wrong there
And it's true I belong there
And it's true it's my home
From ocean to ocean

To my piney wood home
Maybe someday I'll find
Someone who will
Love as I love my piney wood hills

Goin up Cripple Creek, goin in a whirl
Goin up Cripple Creek to see my little girl

a Buddhist and a Baptist and a Jew

And he's fighting for Democracy

He says it's for the peace of all
He's the one who must decide
who's to live and who's to die
and he never sees the writing on the walls
But without him how would Hitler have
condemned him at Dachau
Without him Caesar would have stood alone
He's the one who gives his body
as a weapon to a war
and without him all this killing can't go on
He's the universal soldier and he
really is to blame
His orders come from far away no more
They come from him, and you, and me

Changing woman, dance on the weather lightening and feather mark her trail

That you have held your head high

and you feel in your heart for these ones
Oh it's written in books and in song
that we've been mistreated and wronged
Well over and over I hear those same words
from you good lady and you good man
Well listen to me if you care where we stand
and you feel you're a part of these ones
When a war between nations is lost
the loser we know pays the cost
but even when Germany fell to your hands
consider dear lady, consider dear man
you left them their pride and you left them their land
and what have you done to these ones
Has a change come about my dear man
or are you still taking our lands
A treaty forever your senators sign
They do dear lady, they do dear man
and the treaties are broken again and again
and what will you do for these ones"

God is alive; Magic is afoot
God is afoot; Magic is alive
Alive is afoot.....
Magic never died.
God never sickened;
Many poor men lied
Many sick men lied
Magic never weakened
Magic never hid
Magic always ruled
God is afoot
God never died.
God was ruler
Though his funeral lengthened
Though his mourners thickened
Magic never fled
Though his shrouds were hoisted
The naked God did live
Though his words were twisted
The naked Magic thrived
Though his death was published
Round and round the world
The heart did not believe
Many hurt men wondered
Many struck men bled
Magic never faltered
Magic always led.
Many stones were rolled
But God would not lie down
Many wild men lied
Many fat men listened
Though they offered stones
Magic still was fed
Though they locked their coffers
God was always served.
Magic is afoot. God rules.
Alive is afoot. Alive is in command.
Many weak men hungered
Many strong men thrived
Though they boasted solitude
God was at their side
Nor the dreamer in his cell
Nor the captain on the hill
Magic is alive
Though his death was pardoned
Round and round the world
The heart did not believe.
Though laws were carved in marble
They could not shelter men
Though altars built in parliaments
They could not order men
Police arrested Magic
And Magic went with them,
For Magic loves the hungry.
But Magic would not tarry
It moves from arm to arm
It would not stay with them
Magic is afoot
It cannot come to harm
It rests in an empty palm
It spawns in an empty mind
But Magic is no instrument
Magic is the end.
Many men drove Magic
But Magic stayed behind
Many strong men lied
They only passed through Magic
And out the other side
Many weak men lied
They came to God in secret
And though they left him nourished
They would not say who healed
Though mountains danced before them
They said that God was dead
Though his shrouds were hoisted
The naked God did live
This I mean to whisper to my mind
This I mean to laugh with in my mind
This I mean my mind to serve 'til
Service is but Magic
Moving through the world
And mind itself is Magic
Coursing through the flesh
And flesh itself is Magic
Dancing on a clock
And time itself the magic length of God."
"2682" "Yesterday a child came out to wonder
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
And tearful at the falling of a star
Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
Skated over ten clear frozen streams
Words like, when you're older, must appease him
And promises of someday make his dreams
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look behind
From where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game
Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
Cartwheels turn to car wheels thru the town
And they tell him,
Take your time, it won't be long now
Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look behind
From where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game
So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty
Before the last revolving year is through
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look behind
From where we came
And go round and round and round

In your school propaganda
They starve in their splendor?
You've asked for my comment I simply will render
My country 'tis of thy people you're dying.
Now that the longhouses breed superstition
You force us to send our toddlers away
To your schools where they're taught to despise their traditions.
Forbid them their languages, then further say
That American history really began
When Columbus set sail out of Europe, then stress
That the nation of leeches that conquered this land
Are the biggest and bravest and boldest and best.
And yet where in your history books is the tale
Of the genocide basic to this country's birth,
Of the preachers who lied, how the Bill of Rights failed,
How a nation of patriots returned to their earth?
And where will it tell of the Liberty Bell
As it rang with a thud
O'er Kinzua mud
And of brave Uncle Sam in Alaska this year?
My country 'tis of thy people you're dying
Hear how the bargain was made for the West:
With her shivering children in zero degrees,
Blankets for your land, so the treaties attest,
Oh well, blankets for land is a bargain indeed,
And the blankets were those Uncle Sam had collected
From smallpox-diseased dying soldiers that day.
And the tribes were wiped out and the history books censored,
A hundred years of your statesmen have felt it's better this way.
And yet a few of the conquered have somehow survived,
Their blood runs the redder though genes have paled.
From the Grand Canyon's caverns to craven sad hills
The wounded, the losers, the robbed sing their tale.
From Los Angeles County to upstate New York
The white nation fattens while others grow lean;
Oh the tricked and evicted they know what I mean.
My country 'tis of thy people you're dying.
The past it just crumbled, the future just threatens;
Our life blood shut up in your chemical tanks.
And now here you come, bill of sale in your hands
And surprise in your eyes that we're lacking in thanks
For the blessings of civilization you've brought us,
The lessons you've taught us, the ruin you've wrought us
Oh see what our trust in America's brought us.
My country 'tis of thy people you're dying.
Now that the pride of the sires receives charity,
Now that we're harmless and safe behind laws,
Now that my life's to be known as yourheritage,
Now that even the graves have been robbed,
Now that our own chosen way is a novelty
Hands on our hearts we salute you your victory,
Choke on your blue white and scarlet hypocrisy
Pitying the blindness that you've never seen
That the eagles of war whose wings lent you glory
They were never no more than carrion crows,
Pushed the wrens from their nest, stole their eggs, changed their story;
The mockingbird sings it, it's all that he knows.
\"Ah what can I do?\" say a powerless few
With a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye
Can't you see that their poverty's profiting you.

He'd get so mad he'd burn himself
Satan knew my grandma well
He tried his best to test her faith
He sent grandpa to his grave
And he talked her into blaming herself
Satan knew my grandma well
With a Bible for her sword and shield
She fought him on the battlefield
Kneeled down beside her bed
For hours on that tear stained floor
Till he couldn't take anymore
He even prayed to hear her say amen
Satan knew my grandma well
He could hear her prayers clear down in hell
She made him wish he never fell
Satan knew my grandma well
I was 6 years old in Sylvan Park
Satan tried to get me in his car

Satan knew my grandma well
With a Bible for her sword and shield
She fought him on the battlefield
Kneeled down beside her bed
For hours on that tear stained floor

If she picked one, she picked a hundred bales.
Me and all my brothers would take turn about,
Dragging mama's sack up to the scales.
While little baby sister slept in peaceful sleep.
Mama laid her in the trailer shade.
Daddy was in Danville working for the railroad.
When he was coming home we couldn't wait
.
These are just some things I want to sing about
Memories I can't live without.
Diamonds buried deep down in my mind.
Thoughts I can't quit thinking,
A fountain I'll keep drinking from,
And a taste that's gettin' sweeter all the time.
[ Break]
I remember thinking town was where Grandmother's lived.
Where brothers went to catch a bus or train.
A treasured thought was daddy grinnin' ear to ear
Every time we'd hear the old Chuck Wagon Gang.
Among the many things I can't forget about,
Was seeing mama bowed in silent prayer.
I turned and left her slowly, without her ever knowing
There was ever anybody there."

I flew up to Tennessee to visit him once more
It didn't shock me, none to hear that he'd been brave
He'd lost his own life but another one was saved
I waited by a tree till everyone had left
I went up and said a prayer where my pal slept
And then I heard a voice I hadn't heard in years
I didn't need to turn around I knew just who was there

Where dim lights bring forgetfulness

Where I was born and raised
Staring at the dusty fields
Where my daddy worked hard everyday
I think it kinda hurt him when I said
Daddy there's a lot that I don't know
But don't you ever dream
About a life where corn don't grow?\"
He just sat there silent
Staring at his favorite coffee cup
I saw a storm of mixed emotions
In his eyes when he looked up
He said, Son I know at your age
It seems like this old world is turnin' slow
And you think you'll find the answer to it all
Where corn don't grow\"
Hard times are real
There's dusty fields no matter where you go
You may change your mind
'Cause the weeds are high where corn don't grow
I remember feeling guilty
When daddy turned and walked back in the house
I was only 17 back then but I thought
That I knew more than I know now
I can't say he didn't warn me
This city life's a hard roe to hoe
Ain't it funny how a dream
Can turn around where corn don't grow
Hard times are real
There's dusty fields no matter where you go

Than to stand in the bar of a pub with no beer
Now the Publican's anxious for the quota to come
There's a faraway look on the face of the bum
The maid's gone all cranky and the cook's acting queer
What a terrible place is a pub with no beer
The stock man rides up with his dry, dusty throat
He breasts up till the bar, pulls a wad from his coat
But the smile on his face quickly turns to a sneer
When the barman says suddenly, \"The pub's got no beer\"
There's a dog on the verandah, for his master he waits
But the boss is inside drinking wine with his mates
He hurries for cover and he cringes in fear
It's no place for a dog round a pub with no beer
Old Billy, the blacksmith, the first time in his life
Has gone home cold sober to his darling wife
He walks in the kitchen, she says, \"You're early, me dear\"
Then he breaks down and he tells her that the pub's got no beer

Way down upon the Isle of Grain

No money if you stop for rain

Your shoulders cut to bits and seared
And woe to he who to looks for tea

Fell into a concrete stairs
What the Horseface said, when he saw him dead
Well, it wasn't what the rich call prayers
I'm a navvy short was the one retort
That reached unto my ears
When the going is rough, well you must be tough
With McAlpine's fusiliers
I've worked 'till the sweat has had me bet
With Russian, Czech and Pole
On shuddering jams up in the hydro dams
Or underneath the Thames in a hole

And many a ganger's fist across me ears

"2760" "Dear sir I write this note to you to tell me of me plight,
And at the time of writing, I am not a pretty sight.
Me body is all black and blue, me face a deathly gray.
And I write this note to say, why Paddy's not at work today.
While working on the fourteenth floor some bricks I had to clear.
Now to throw them down from such a height, was not a good idea.
The foreman wasn't very pleased, he being an awkward sod.
He said I'd have to carry them down the ladders in me hod.
Now, clearing all these bricks by hand, it was so very slow.
So I hoisted up a barrel, and secured the rope below.
But in me haste to do the job, I was too blind to see;
That a barrel full of building bricks was heavier than me.
So when I untied the rope, the barrel fell like lead.
And clinging tightly to the rope I started up instead.
While I shot up like a rocket, to my dismay I found,
That halfway up, I met the bloody barrel coming down.
Well, the barrel broke my shoulders as to the ground it sped,
And when I reached the top, I banged the pulley with me head.
Well I clung on tight though numb and shock from this almighty blow,
And the barrel spilled out half the bricks fourteen floors below.
Now, when these bricks had fallen from the barrel to the floor,
I then outweighed the barrel, and so started down once more.
Still clinging tightly to the rope, I sped towards the ground.
And I landed on the broken bricks that were all scattered 'round.
While I lay their groaning on the ground I thought I passed the worst,
When the barrel hit the pulley wheel, and then the bottom burst.
Well a shower of bricks rained down on me - I hadn't got a hope.
As I lay there moaning on the ground: I let go of the bloody rope.
The barrel then being heavier it started down once more,
And landed right across me as I lay across the floor.
Well it broke three ribs, and my left arm, and I can only say;
That I hope you'll understand why Paddy's not at work today."

In a skirt of navy blue

And her blouse was newly dyed
So you couldn't bate her amber locks
Down by the Liffey side
And on her old melodeon
How sweetly could she play
She played goodbye and do not sigh
And down by Texas Way
And when she turned Sinn Feiner
I nearly burst with pride
For to hear her sing the 'Soldier's song'
Down by the Liffey side
On Sunday morning to Meath Street
Together we will go
And up to Father Murphy there

"2768" "'Twas down by the Glenside I met an old woman
A plucking young nettles she ne'er saw me coming
I listened a while to the song she was humming
Glory o glory o to the Bold Fenian Men
It`s fifty long years since I saw the moon beamin'
On strong manly force, their eyes with hope gleamin'
I see them again through all my sad dreamin'
Glory o glory o to the Bold Fenian Men
Some died by the hillside, some died with the stranger
And wise men have told us their cause was a failure
But they loved their old Ireland and they never feared danger
Glory o glory o to the Bold Fenian Men
I passed on my way, God be praised that I met her
Be life long or short, I will never forget her
We may have brave men but we'll never have better
Glory o glory o to the Bold Fenian Men"
"2769" "Fine girl you are!
Adieu to you my Dinah a thousand times adieu
We`re going away from the Holy Ground and the girls that we love true
We will sail the South sea over and then return for sure
To see again the girls we love and the Holy Ground once more
Chorus:
Fine girl you are! Your`re the girl that I adore
and still I live in hopes to see The Holy Ground once more. Fine girls you are!
See the storm a-rising I see it coming soon,
And the sky it is so cloudy you can scarcely see the moon.
And the good old ship, she was tossing about,
The riggin`was all tore, and still I live with hopes to see, The Holy ground once more.
And now the storm it is over and we are safe on shore,
We will drink a toast to the Holy Ground and the girls that we adore.
We will drink strong ale and porter and make the rafters roar,
And when our money is all spent we`ll go to sea for more."
"2770" "Good evening, all my jolly lads, I'm glad to find you well
If you'll gather all around me, now, the story I will tell
For I've got a situation and begorrah and begob
I can whisper all the weekly wage of nineteen bob
'Tis twelve months come October since I left me native home
After helping them Killarney boys to bring the harvest down
But now I wear the gansey and around me waist a belt
I'm the gaffer of the squad that makes the hot asphalt
Well, we laid it in a hollows and we laid it in the flat
And if it doesn't last forever, sure I swear, I'll eat me hat
Well, I've wandered up and down the world and sure I never felt
Any surface that was equal to the hot asphalt
The other night a copper comes and he says to me, McGuire
Would you kindly let me light me pipe down at your boiler fire?
And he planks himself right down in front, with hobnails up, till late
And says I, me decent man, you'd better go and find your bait
He ups and yells, I'm down on you, I'm up to all yer pranks
Don't I know you for a traitor from the Tipperary ranks?
Boys, I hit straight from the shoulder and I gave him such a belt
That I knocked him into the boiler full of hot asphalt
Well, we laid it in a hollows and we laid it in the flat
And if it doesn't last forever, sure I swear, I'll eat me hat
Well, I've wandered up and down the world and sure I never felt
Any surface that was equal to the hot asphalt
We quickly dragged him out again and we threw him in the tub
And with soap and warm water we began to rub and scrub
But devil the thing, it hardened and it turned him hard as stone
And with every other rub, sure you could hear the copper groan
I'm thinking, says O'Reilly, that he's lookin' like old Nick
And burn me if I am not inclined to claim him with me pick
Now, says I, it would be easier to boil him till he melts
And to stir him nice and easy in the hot asphalt
Well, we laid it in a hollows and we laid it in the flat
And if it doesn't last forever, sure I swear, I'll eat me hat
Well, I've wandered up and down the world and sure I never felt
Any surface that was equal to the hot asphalt
You may talk about yer sailor lads, ballad singers and the rest
Your shoemakers and your tailors but we please the ladies best
The only ones who know the way their flinty hearts to melt
Are the lads around the boiler making hot asphalt
With rubbing and with scrubbing, sure I caught me death of cold
For scientific purposes, me body it was sold
In the Kelvin grove museum, me boys, I'm hangin' in me pelt
As a monument to the Irish, making hot asphalt
Well, we laid it in a hollows and we laid it in the flat
And if it doesn't last forever, sure I swear, I'll eat me hat
Well, I've wandered up and down the world and sure I never felt
Any surface that was equal to the hot asphalt"

Who have no treasure but hope,
No riches laid up but a memory of an ancient glory
My mother bore me in bondage, in bondage my mother was born,
I am of the blood of serfs;
The children with whom I have played, the men and women with whom I have eaten
Have had masters over them, have been under the lash of masters,
and though gentle, have served churls.
The hands that have touched mine,
the dear hands whose touch Is familiar to me
Have worn shameful manacles, have been bitten at the wrist by manacles,
have grown hard with the manacles and the task-work of strangers.
I am flesh of the flesh of these lowly, I am bone of their bone I that have never submitted;
I that have a soul greater than the souls of my people's masters,
I that have vision and prophecy, and the gift of fiery speech,
I that have spoken with God on the top of his holy hill.
And because I am of the people, I understand the people,
I am sorrowful with their sorrow, I am hungry with their desire;
My heart is heavy with the grief of mothers,
My eyes have been wet with the tears of children,
I have yearned with old wistful men,
And laughed and cursed with young men;
Their shame is my shame, and I have reddened for it
Reddened for that they have served, they who should be free
Reddened for that they have gone in want, while others have been full,
Reddened for that they have walked in fear of lawyers and their jailors.
With their Writs of Summons and their handcuffs,
Men mean and cruel.
I could have borne stripes on my body
Rather than this shame of my people.
And now I speak, being full of vision:
I speak to my people, and I speak in my people's name to
The masters of my people:
I say to my people that they are holy,
That they are august despite their chains.
That they are greater than those that hold them
And stronger and purer,
That they have but need of courage, and to call on the name of their God,
God the unforgetting, the dear God who loves the people
For whom he died naked, suffering shame.
And I say to my people's masters: Beware
Beware of the thing that is coming, beware of the risen people
Who shall take what ye would not give.
Did ye think to conquer the people, or that law is stronger than life,
And than men's desire to be free?
We will try it out with you ye that have harried and held,
Ye that have bullied and bribed.
Tyrants... hypocrites... liars!"

And Clean up your cell!\"

I saw her first and knew
That her dark hair would weave a snare
That I might one day rue
I saw the danger, yet I passed
Along the enchanted way
And I said, let grief be a falling leaf
At the dawning of the day
On Grafton Street in November
We tripped lightly along the ledge
Of a deep ravine where can be seen
The worth of passions pledged
The Queen of Hearts still making tarts
And I not making hay
Oh, I loved too much and by such, by such
Is happiness thrown away
I gave her gifts of the mind
I gave her the secret sign
That's known to the artists who have known
The true gods of sound and stone
And word and tint I did not stint
For I gave her poems to say
With her own name there and her own dark hair
Like clouds over fields of May
On a quiet street where old ghosts meet
I see her walking now
Away from me so hurriedly
My reason must allow
That I had loved not as I should
A creature made of clay
When the angel woos the clay
He'll lose his wings at dawn of day"

Said it was a shame.

And they hung me on high,
And they left me there
On a Cross to die.

It's hard to dance
With the devil on your back.

"2788" "'Twas down the glen one Easter morn
To a city fair rode I.
When armed line of marching men
In squadrons passed me by.
No pipes did hum, no battle drum
Did sound its loud tattoo
But the Angelus bell o'er the Liffey's swell
Rang out in the foggy dew.
Right proudly high over Dublin town
They hung out a flag of war.
'Twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky
Than at Suvla or Sud el Bar.
And from the plains of Royal Meath
Strong men came hurrying through;
While Brittania's huns with their great big guns
Sailed in through the foggy dew.
'Twas England bade our wild geese go
That small nations might be free.
But their lonely graves are by Suvla's waves
On the fringe of the gray North Sea.
But had they died by Pearse's side
Or fought with Cathal Brugha,
Their names we'd keep where the Fenians sleep
'Neath the shroud of the foggy dew.
The bravest fell, and the solemn bell
Rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Watertide
In the springing of the year.
And the world did gaze with deep amaze
At those fearless men, but few
Who bore the fight that freedom's light
Might shine through the foggy dew."

Left the girls of Tuam so sad and broken hearted,
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother,
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother,
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born,
Cut a stout black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins;
Bought a pair of brogues rattling o'er the bogs
And fright'ning all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin.
One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

Started by daylight next morning blithe and early,
Took a drop of pure to keep me heartfrom sinking;
Thats a Paddy's cure whenever he's on drinking.
See the lassies smile, laughing all the while
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'
Asked me was I hired, wages I required,

To be soon deprived a view of that fine city.
So then I took a stroll, all among the quality;
Me bundle it was stole, all in a neat locality.
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind,
No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin'
Enquiring for the rogue, they said me Connaught brogue
Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin.

Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !
From there I got away, me spirits never falling,
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing.
The Captain at me roared, said that no room had he;
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy.
Down among the pigs, played some hearty rigs,
Danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling;
When off Holyhead I wished meself was dead,
Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin.
One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !
Well the boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed,
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it.
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing;
Poor old Erin's Isle they began abusing.

Some Galway boys were nigh and saw I was a hobble in,
With a load \"hurray !\" joined in the affray.
We quitely cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin.

the town that I have loved so well
where our school played ball by the gasyard wall
and we laughed through the smoke and the smell.
Going home in the rain running up the dark lane
past the jail and down behind the fountain
Those were happy days in so many many ways
in the town I loved so well.
In the early morning the shirt-factory horn
called women from Craigeen the Moor and the Bog
while the man on the dole played the mother`s role
fed the children and then trained the dogs.
And when times got tough there was just about enough
but they saw it through without complaining
for deep inside was a burning pride
for the town I loved so well.
There was music there in the Derry air
like a language that we all could understand
I remember the day when I earned my first pay
as I played in the small pick-up band.
There I spent my youth and to tell you the truth
I was sad to leave it all behind me
for I`d learned `bout life and I`ve found me a wife
in the town I loved so well.
But when I returned how my eyes have burned
to see how a town could be brought ti its knees
by the armored cars and the bombed-out bars
and the gas that hangs on to every breeze.
Now the army`s installed by that old gasyard wall
and the damned barbwire gets high and higher
with their tanks and their guns, oh my god what have they done
to the town I loved so well."

Only desire

That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'

More will set sail

Baltimore
But the cruel sea has beat'n me and I'll end my days on

From Killybegs town

County Down

Fine friends would all be lost

And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
\"Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here\"
Then the storm it broke and drove the boat, to the
Rocks about ten miles from shore
As we fought the tide, we hoped inside to see our homes
Once more
Then we struck a rock and holed the bow and all of us
Knew that she'd go down
So we jumped right into the icy sea and prayed to God
We wouldn't drown
But the ragin' sea was risin' still as we struck out
For the land
And she fought with all her cruelty to claim that
Gallant band
By Saint John's point in the early dawn I dragged
Myself on the shore
And I cursed the sea for what she'd done and vowed to
Sail her never more
So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
\"Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here\"
Ever since that night I've been on the road, travelin'
And tryin' to forget
That awful night I lost all my friends, I see their
Faces yet
And often at night when the sea is high and the rain is
Tearing at my skin
I hear the cries of drowning men, floating over on the
Wind
So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'
\"Donegal Danny's been here, me boys,
Donegal Danny's been here\"
So here's to those that are dead and gone, the friends
That I loved dear
And here's to you and I'll bid you adieu, sayin'

"2811" "The Band Played Waltzing Matilda, Eric Bogle
When I was a young man I carried me pack
And I lived the free life of the rover
From the Murray's green basin to the dusty outback
I waltzed my Matilda all over
Then in 1915 my country said: Son,
It's time to stop rambling, there's work to be done
So they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun
And they sent me away to the war
And the band played Waltzing Matilda
When the ship pulled away from the quay
And amid all the tears, flag waving and cheers
We sailed off for Gallipoli
It well I remember that terrible day
When our blood stained the sand and the water
And how in that hell they call Suvla Bay
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter
Johnny Turk, he was ready, he primed himself well
He rained us with bullets, and he showered us with shell
And in five minutes flat, we were all blown to hell
He nearly blew us back home to Australia
And the band played Waltzing Matilda
When we stopped to bury our slain
Well we buried ours and the Turks buried theirs
Then it started all over again
Oh those that were living just tried to survive
In that mad world of blood, death and fire
And for ten weary weeks I kept myself alive
While around me the corpses piled higher
Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over head
And when I awoke in me hospital bed
And saw what it had done, I wished I was dead
I never knew there was worse things than dying
Oh no more I'll go Waltzing Matilda
All around the green bush far and near
For to hump tent and pegs, a man needs both legs
No more waltzing Matilda for me
They collected the wounded, the crippled, the maimed
And they shipped us back home to Australia
The armless, the legless, the blind and the insane
Those proud wounded heroes of Suvla
And when the ship pulled into Circular Quay
I looked at the place where me legs used to be
And thank Christ there was no one there waiting for me
To grieve and to mourn and to pity
And the Band played Waltzing Matilda
When they carried us down the gangway
Oh nobody cheered, they just stood there and stared
Then they turned all their faces away
Now every April I sit on my porch
And I watch the parade pass before me
I see my old comrades, how proudly they march
Renewing their dreams of past glories
I see the old men all tired, stiff and worn
Those weary old heroes of a forgotten war
And the young people ask \"What are they marching for?\"
And I ask myself the same question
And the band plays Waltzing Matilda
And the old men still answer the call
But year after year, their numbers get fewer
Someday, no one will march there at all
Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
Who'll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me?
And their ghosts may be heard as they march by the billabong
So who'll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me?"
"2812" "In a neat little town they called Belfast
Apprentice to trade I was bound
And many an hour sweet happiness
Have I spent in that neat little town
As sad misfortune came over me
Which caused me to stray from the land
Far away from me friends and relations
betrayed by the black velvet band
Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band
I took a stroll down broadway
Meaning not long for to stay
When who should I meet but this pretty fair maid
come a-traipsing along the highway
She was both fair and handsome
Her neck, it was just like a swan
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band
Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band
I took a stroll with this pretty fair maid
And a gentleman passing us by
Well, I knew she meant the doing of him
By the look in her roguish black eye
A gold watch she took from his pocket
And placed it right into my hand
And the very first thing that I said, was
Bad 'cess to the black velvet band
Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band
Before the judge and the jury
Next morning, I had to appear
The judge, he says to me:
\"Young man, you're case it is proven clear
We'll give you seven years penal servitude
To be spent far away from the land
Far away from your friends and relations
Betrayed by the black velvet band\"
Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band
So come all you jolly young fellows
A warning take by me
When you are out on the town, me lads
Beware of the pretty colleens
They'll feed you with strong drink, me lads
'Til you are unable to stand
And the very first thing that you'll know is
You've landed in Van Diemens Land
Her eyes they shown like diamonds
Her neck, it was just like a swan
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band"

Only for nights in Ballygrand
I would swim over the deepest ocean
Only for nights in Ballygrand
But the sea is wide and I cannot swim over
And neither have I the wings to fly
I wish I had a handsome boatsman
To ferry me over my love and I
(This verse is only sung on the 40 years cd)
My childhood days bring back sad reflections
Of happy times there spent so long ago
My boyhood friends and my own relations
Have all past on now with the melting snow
So I'll spend my days in this endless roving
Soft is the grass and shore, my bed is free
Oh to be home now in carrickfergus
On the long rode down to the salty sea
Now in Kilkenny it is reported
On marble stone there as black as ink
With gold and silver I would support her
But I'll sing no more now til I get a drink
Cause I'm drunk today and I'm seldom sober
A handsome rover from town to town
Ah but I'm sick now my days are number
Come all me young men and lay me down
Come all me young men and lay me down."

Let the beat roll hard enough that we guarantee the chorus drop
Like this
Chorus"
"2824" "CHORUS:
Stop setting me up, you keep knocking me down
I'm picking myself back off of the ground
Mad at myself 'cuz I keep hanging around
You got this hold on me (hold on me)
Verse 1:
She brought me to life with the love and the care that she had
And showed me the way we were supposed to be
This love wa s fairy tale 'til evertyhing here got hold of me
Started molding me and folding me, I'll never be the shape you need
Stop chasing me and making me be something I'm not made to be
'Cuz I cant be that, I don't got puppet strings
If I was man enough I'd get my ass right up and leave
But I think I'm stuck to you, its a sick disease
And baby girl..you keep infecting me
Verse 2:"
"2825" "We gon' go back and forth with the games we play
I'm looking all around 'cuz I know it's changed
And I know (I know)
It'll never be quite the same
We gon' chase the past like we hope it lasts
Life is flying by now way too fast
And I know (I know)
It'll never be quite the same
Verse 1:
It'll never be quite the same the day
That people around will know my name
And everything else will fall in place
Now, oh my god, I've had a taste
Of what it'd be like to rock a crowd
And making my mom and daddy proud
I remember the day I slowed it down
Articulating words pronounced
I'm bending it backwards here
We blowing up out of the atmosphere
Showing you people the passion's real
And now I think my asthma's cleared
I can breathe now
I can dream
I can be anything in the world I wanna be
'Cuz I, I put in the time here
I grinded hard y'all
We putting these cleats on
It's time to play hard ball
I'll never give up
Even when it's all corrupt
Hands to the sky 'cuz you know that we feelin' love
CHORUS
Verse 2 (P.Sanders):
Things are changing, montage
People comin' and go, but then they pop like a garage
And it's just life changing, if you know what I've been sayin'
Rappin' with the guitars is just a miracle in the makin'
They say, left and right but I guess I'm going up
No matter what they say, the feelings just not enough
Toss the mic, forget the moment and get past the hype
See, music never dies
It has an afterlife
Look at me, look at me, yea, look at me now
Life is passin' by
I need another round
King of the world
King of the dream
King of my hometown
You got one life to live
You better live it now"
"2826" "Chorus:
I let you see a side of me
And now there's a fire in my head
Can't calm it down or put it out
I guess its the way it's supposed to be
Verse 1:
Now I'm a victim of my own incarceration
Treated like a criminal but also like a patient
Can't make it through one evaluation
Without the guidance of a little bad persuasion
Now you opened up a side of me
That no one controls and my mind is free
One side's just filled with hate
And that side's alive and inside of me
So if you're strong enough, let's push it back in me
Suppress all the pain
Otherwise they'll be another casualty
Chorus
Verse 2:
There's a fire pent in me
And I don't even really want the world to see
How it burns so bright when you around
I try to get up but I get knocked down
How is it possible that you could be just another obstacle
Flipping the switch now I'm off the wall
If life is a game I need an audible
Go silent and drift away
Go find your gift today
That gift of love and hate
And push 'til it feels like your head'll break
Don't make the same mistakes
It's too hot when we touch the flames
It's so sad when the lives are claimed
I should be ashamed that I
Chorus
Bridge:
This fire in my head,
This fire in my
This fire in my head
this fire in my
Head.

"2827" "Chorus:
Feeling on my flow now she really wanna go
Tell her that I love her but she knows it ain't so
Her heart starts racing now she's ready to explode
Ima make her mine by the end of the show
Verse 1:
Hook line sinker, got her turn like a blinker
Have her bouncing out her clothes
While I'm jumping out the speaker
Keep it kicking like a sneaker
And she knows I wanna freak her
Baby girl I don't know your name
But I'd really like to meet ya, oh
Let's go on a full speed grind
Keep your two cents
My baby girl's a dime
Fine, mine, and so divine
She got her mouth open while I'm blowing her mind
Got her showing her shine, with her lip gloss on
Melting in my hands while I rip this song
Flip that on, don't get me wrong
Ima hit that shit like all night long
CHORUS
Verse 2:
Jazz it up, shake it out
She got me going crazy when she break it down
That body vibrating when we play it loud
Hat turned back with the A-town down
She's the only one that I see in here
All decked out in the AK gear
I'm like, hey there dear, put your name on here
If the fame ain't clear then the game gon' steer
Pedal to the metal now she's hot as flames
All we really want is some whips and chains
Yo, call her highness, baby's still the finest
Chick that I see even through the blindness
With my guidance she could be timeless
So rewind this, study what I'm finding
She gon' want a label that is prolly gonna bind us
All I gotta say is don't try this, flyness
CHORUS
Bridge/Verse 3:
I watched a butterfly go shutter by
Now she's digging in on this gutter guy
And I wonder why she's hooked on me
Must be the way that I move the beat
Or move my feet, so smoothily
Heart starts pounding, sounding good to me
Groove and sing, just feel the vibe
I'm locked on my red lipped cyanide
Guys have tried, but she shot 'em down
She only looking for that man with the golden crown
She can scan around but she knows I'm down
She can see it in my eyes and the way I sound
You feeling it, I'm feeling it
You killing it, I'm killing it
Lets be real girl
I got you
CHORUS x2
Feelin' on my flow
I got her
Never let her go
I got her"

"2830" "Fare you well, my own true love
Farewell for a while
I am going away but I'll be back
If I go ten thousand miles
Ten thousand miles, my own true love
Ten thousand miles or more
And the rocks may melt and the seas may burn
If I no more return
Oh don't you see yon lonesome dove
Sitting on yon ivy tree
She is weeping for her own true love
As I shall weep for mine
Oh come back, my own true love
And stay a while with me
If I had a friend all on this earth
You have been a friend to me"
"2831" "The trees, they grow high, and the leaves, they do grow green
Many is the time my true love I've seen
Many an hour I watched him all alone
He's young but he's daily growing
Father, dear father, you've done me great wrong
You have married me to a boy who is too young
I am twice twelve and he is but fourteen
He's young but he's daily growing
Daughter, dear daughter, I've done you no wrong
I have married you to a great lord's son
And he will be a man for you when I am dead and gone
He's young but he's daily growing
Father, dear father, if you see fit
We'll send him to college for another year yet
I'll tie a blue ribbon all around his head
To let the maidens know that he is married
One day I was looking over my father's castle wall
I spied all the boys playing with a ball
And my own true love, he was the flower of them all
He's young but he's daily growing
And so early in the morning at the dawning of the day
They went into a hayfield for to have some sport and play
And what they did there she never would declare
But she never more complained of his growing
At the age of fourteen he was a married man
At the age of fifteen, the father of my son
At the age of sixteen, his grave, it was green
And death had put an end to his growing
I'll buy my love some flannel, I'll make my love a shroud
And every stitch I put in it, the tears, they'll pour down
Amd every stitch I put in it, how the tears, they will flow
Cruel fate has put an end to his growing"

are building a shed
Between here and heaven between the wait and the
wedding for as long as we both shall be dead
to the world beyond the boys and the girls trying
to keep us calm
We can practice our lines 'til we're deaf and blind
to ourselves to each other where it's
Fall not winter spring not summer cool not cold
And it's warm not hot have we all forgotten that
we're getting old
With an arrow and bow and some seeds left to sow
we are staking our claim
On ground so fertile we forget who we've hurt along
the way and reach out for a strange hand
to hold someone strong but not bold enough to
tear down the wall
'Cause we ain't lost enough to find the stars ain't
crossed why align them why fall hard
not soft into
Fall not winter spring not summer cool not cold
Where it's warm not hot have we all forgotten that
we're getting old"

Using faith like an acrobat 'til the net breaks

That though we've never met
I know, everything he's said 'cause a friend once told me
He's got hell fire in his eyes
There is madness behind the lies
He would burn us all alive just to prove his point
God save the believer
We mistake for a deceiver
'Cause it makes us feel better
The time has come and gone
To say what's right and wrong
People like him don't belong 'cause we're all okay
You'd better write him off
Without a second thought
'Cause thinking just leads to getting caught in the traps he sets, like
Who is that on his knees?
It's that daring young man from the flying trapeze
Crying \"father, father, help me please\" well good luck, pal
'Cause you're gonna need it
God save the believer
We mistake for a deceiver

Who's seen a black Mercedes at the textile mill
And spreads the word to all the folks expression hasn't killed
I'll follow that car down to Boston ask what it wanted in Maine
Coffee at least for my trouble
I'll be a hero if I came back with something to say
Too late, they wouldn't like me there
And though they might not mind my inquisitive stare
Every single one of them is too polite to care
Why I'm enchanted by a way of life in disrepair
I'm not talking apple pie eating, jack and coke drinking
Hopeful, lie telling, anywhere America, camera eyes
On a Hollywood body that could make you all cry
Maybe I'll go to the movies, a comedy would be ideal
Something that probably won't happen

Oh, the heart beats in its cage
All your friends are laughing at us
All the ones you loved you mistrust
Help me now I'm not quite myself
Look around there's no one else left
Well I went to the concert and I fought through the crowd
Guess I got too excited when I thought you were around

Feeling like I'm feeling now, inbetween the skies and clouds where everyone's identity is just a picture card they need
I came from California with an appetite for my own myths of music, love, and what they mean, I'm told it's borderline obscene
I tried to write this song before but had no one to write it for. My fellow travellers' vacant stares leave it up to you to care
I could write a song and have the Lord put you and me in a cup he tries to pour out
looking in at the passengers from the wing ... I'm nowhere and you're everything
You came from Illinois with a cup of your very own to sip Neveron route for very long, just there and doing something wrong
or so your friends and parents said, but if you hadn't you'd be dead what you've been given doesn't scare me,
all your sights and sounds prepare me
I could write a song and have the Lord put you and me in a cup he tries to pour out
looking in at the passengers from the wing ... I'm nowhere and you're everything
Damn this cup bring me a bowl,
If I can't saturate my soul
with you and him who drank it first
and last I'm ready for the worst
It's way past two and you want me there,
Well he needs me here
so you have to share

Forgot who I was and who I was fooling
Didnt remember she could be my first cue to run
We moved so fast
Never thought twice
Mind came at last
Put us on ice
We stayed in touch but the touch I was wanting from her
Came from girls that scared me too little to love
So all of the thoughts I thought I might tell her
Turned into songs that until now shes never heard of
I had been taught
Love is a vice
Took all these thoughts
And I put them on ice
The vice bends and ice tends to melt
One night she asked me how I felt
The next day I woke up lying to myself
I feel fine, I feel fine, I feel fine
Thank God, youre here, I need you to hear this
So sick of my shit, I promise, Im through tempting fate
I know Im in love now, you are what love is to me

And it would take a miracle
For her to break my fall
Cause she dont care at all anymore
And I dont know why I still do

I lost my faith in our sweet illusion
Where every wound heals

Looking down at you
Singing ideas that we'd just read
Drunk on new truth

'Cause I'm sittin' here in Nashville
With Norman's Nashville blues
So come all you good time rounders
Listenin' to my sound
And drink a round to Nashville
Before they tear it down
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Hard weather, drivin' slow
Buggies and the hats in town for the show
Oh darlin', the songs they played
All I got left is the love we made
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine"
"2852" "I forget the difference between being in love
And being familiar with something I hope I'm above
Hear a lie enough and it cuts like the gospel
'Cuz when you're half-awake, no mistake is impossible
I'm a child again, lost and happy in make believe
I'm lazy now, so someone's pretending for me
An untouchable man who holds his hand out to millions
Anyone can share his beautiful heroes and ugly villains
I spend a lot of time watching my TV
I take what they give me and I give them nothing
But I waste a lot of time watching my TV
Got me right where they want me, ready for anything
I forget the difference between being loved
And being a loose pocket, worn-wallet, short-sighted
Friend to lift money off of
Maybe I'm playing their game
so I can have a show where I stick 'em like a pig one day
Tell 'em they can go to hell 'cause they don't know another way
Or maybe I'm here 'cause it's something to do
You know still waters can run shallow too
I could watch myself run dry
So I spend a lot of time watching my TV
I take what they give me and I give them nothing
But I waste a lot of time watching my TV
Got me right where they want me, ready for anything
I forget the difference between being alive
And living through somebody else who's acting out somebody else's life"

"2855" "I caught a string full of fish down by the damn
I'll drag them back to the field they should be dead by then
Wipe the sweat off my neck and tally ho the plow
I'm gonna grow a woman from the ground
The night was a chalkboard with a fingernail moon
If the fish ain't dead yet they will be pretty soon
Kinda like the feeling at an old folks home
Even though you love them you can't wait for them to go
I'll call her Angelina she's a teacher I once had
A halo of honey wrapped around her head
And she always used to give me some when I was a kid
I told her that I loved her and then I went and hid
I'll take you into town and I'll show you off
And there's room on your dress for a corsage
And I'll open up every door for you
I opened up my almanac and in my head I read
Cut your wrist on the fins of the fish and drain all you can
So I rolled up my sleeves and then began to draw lines just as deep as the days are long
I sewed up my wrist and sewed the ground with my blood
Staind up my clothes pretty good and I turned that dirt to mud
I couldn't help but close my eyes and lay my body down
'Cause I heard it takes forever to grow a woman from the ground
I bleed for you now and I'm skinny as a rail
And I'll be so obliged to keep you nice and warm and safe
And won't you be so proud of me"

Daddy would you sing me a lullaby?
Take my hand and Ill walk you through the fire.
Fear no evil I will cover you my child.

And when you hear this lullaby,
Know I think of you every time.
Because youre my night light,
My night light,
Youre the night light in my dark.
Take my hand and Ill walk you down the aisle
Let her look to be the grace behind your smile
Find a love that mirrors who we are
Keep the wonder in your eyes and shine like stars
And when you feel the tears well up inside,
Just call my name and Ill let you cry.
Because you are my night light,
My night light,
Youre my night light in my dark.
And when you feel the tears well up inside,

said her life were living is is just a game
sat by the campfire she told me a story
we laughed and cried, till the morning came
All is well, all is fine
all is well with Isobel
drinking her wine

Well her daddy left her when she was five
and her momma didn't wanna stick around and be alive
Isobel ran, Isobel escaped
into the lords arms she was saved
Every night before bed, Isobel would pray
ask to be a bird and fly away
she didn't grow wings but her spirit grew strong
and she picked up her things and started walking along
All is well, all is fine
all is well with Isobel

Me and Isobel walking the sunset, barefoot on the long way home
me and Isobel walking the sunset, on the long and winding road"

To make those feelings go away
Till you take me
There`s nothing more that I prefer
To see the boys and the girls
Step it out with grace and pride
As honesty flows by your side
I cannot run from times hard pressed
To become embittered, dispossessed
Just like some do
And maybe some place I can find
Where wheel and heart become entwined
Like I hope to
And nothing matters more to you
To sit and sing a song that`s true
The first one there and last to leave
Sweet memories for you to keep"

Broken like the snows of January
Silence will fall on those masters of shame
When the family garden wakes to spring again
Under the moon and over land
Make the shadows of the chosen one
With words of mercy in his hand
He walks the path of peace a wounded man
Out of sight and out of mind
The devil`s staircase winding high
Make it secret make it sudden
And the family garden wakes to frosty ground
In Europe's towns tonight
They lie awake again to fear the dawn
An endless story of empty glory"

To justify all the hurt inside
Guess she knows from the smiles and the look in their eyes
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one
They're saying
Mama never loved her much
And daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection
But somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot
To come (and she'll say to him)
She's saying
(Chorus)
I would fly you to the moon and back
If you'll be if you'll be my baby
Got a ticket for a world where
we belong
So would you be my baby
Ooh-ooh
(Verse 2)
She can't remember a time
When she felt needed
If love was red then she was colour-blind
All her friends they've been tried for treason
And crimes that were never defined
She's saying
Love is like a barren place
And reaching out for human faith is
Is like a journey I just don't have a map for
So baby gonna take a dive and push the shift to overdrive
Send a signal that she's hanging all her hopes on the stars
(What a pleasant dream) just saying
(CHORUS x2)
Mamma never loved her much
And daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection
But somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting for the right kind of pilot
To come (and she'll say to him)
She's saying

With the girls of the sheiling.

Have you seen it before

Decreed by the sword and the pen
To be outlaws all over again.
The names in the churchyard are long overgrown
Still she came kneeling with flowers of her own

As counsel finds guilty
For charges unpaid
And even as the last hope is labelled and sold
We're all for one, Mary
Outlawed for gold."

I wonder at this life that passed me be
But still I smile
Although I`m not with you down there
I sit alone up here and stare
It`s me my name is Claire
Claire in heaven
I wait for my next life patiently
I`m in no rush because of what I see
It`s hard for me to understand
I gaze from poisoned sea to poisoned land
Up here I see a new tomorrow
Your world`s not round your world is narrow

A shelter from the pain
Soaring smoke and burning drops of rain
And all around society
Is living on a prayer
Religion holding fort from despair
The heat wave of a thousand fears
Rainbows from a million tears
Echoes of a symphony playing on your mind
And even when the mornings clear
Its hard to find a reason for
The miracle of you and me
The miracle of being
Reflection on the water
Your face is still as night
Staring like a curse in the frozen light
The prince of hidden treasure
He's kissed the green above
And realised a ripple of your love"

Replacing everything I came to fear.
But my head's still trapped inside your sheets.
More and more I think that I killed me.
Growing up under florescent hallways,
Brother lied under hospital tray,
Now I call this place my second home,
Some fears die - others grow.
And I would take his hand and go to the river,
Crisp ice on eyes just made me stronger,
I'd do all his drugs to make it go away,
I still drink. I drink it all away.
Sitting in parking lots, watching stars rise,
Sitting in parking lots, I'll never feel right,
Riding my bike until my face feels numb,
I can't remember the last time these hands were mine,
I fucking hate everything I've become.
Maybe I'm older, but I'm not wiser,
I still feel just as blinded.
And I drove your car alone myself that night,
The heat didn't work - skidded over black ice,
And you walked me home, stumble drunk again,
To a dream that you had that I didn't fit in.
And I swear I tried as best as I could,
To fix broken bridges and make better on good,
I'd follow you, you know that's just me,
It's not what I want but it's how I breath.
Maybe I'm older, but I'm not wiser,
I still feel just as blinded."

A pressgang came to my bedside and stood at my bedhead
Saying, Arise arise you new married man and come along with me,
To the lowlands of Holland to face your (fight the) enemy.
But Holland is a cold place, a place where grows no green
But Holland is a cold place for my love to wander in *
Though money had been so plentiful as leaves grow on the tree
Yet before I'd time to turn myself my love was stolen from me
Be still, be still, my daughter what makes you to lament

There's lads enough in our town but ne'er a one for me
For I never had but one true love and he was pressed from me

Come all ye lads and lasses, and hear my mournful tale,
Ye tender hearts that weep for love to sigh you will not fail,
'Tis all about a young man, and my song will tell you how
He lately came a-courtin' of the Maid of the Sweet Brown Knowe.
Said he, \"My pretty young fair maid, could you and I agree,
To join our hands in wedlock bands, and married we will be;
We'll join our hands in wedlock bands, and you'll have my plighted vow,
That I'll do my whole endeavors for the Maid of the Sweet Brown Knowe.
Now this young and pretty fickle thing, she knew not what to say,
Her eyes did shine like silver bright, and merrily did play;
Says she, \"Young man, your love subdue, I am not ready now,
And I'll spend another season at the foot of the Sweet Brown Knowe.\"
\"Oh,\" says he, \"My pretty young fair maid, now why do you say so?
Look down in yonder valley where my verdant crops do grow.
Look down in yonder valley at my horses and my plough,
All at their daily labor for the Maid of the Sweet Brown Knowe.\"
\"If they're at their daily labor, kind sir, it is not for me.
I've heard of your behavior, I have, kind sir, \" said she;
\"There is an inn where you drop in, I've heard the people say,
Where you rap and you call and you pay for all, and go home by the break of
day.\"
\"If I rap and I call and I pay for all, my money is all my own.
I've never spent aught of your fortune, for I hear that you've got none.
You thought you had my poor heart broke in talkin' to you now,
But I'll leave you where I found you, at the foot of the Sweet Brown Knowe.\"

Going out the west gate for to view the gaslight

There I met with a youth and unto him I said
\"Would you kindly direct me to where I'll get a bed?\"
It was then he directed me down to Cook's Lane,
To where old Dick Darby kept an old sleeping cage
There I put up and down 'til I found out the door,
And I cried, \"Must I then spend the night on the floor?\"*
And the missus came out and these words to me said,
\"If you give me three coppers I'll give you a bed.\"
She took me upstairs and she put out the light,
And in less than five minutes I had to show fight.
In less than five more, sure the story was worse,
For the fleas came about me and brought me a curse.
All round me body they formed an arch,
And all round me body they played the dead march.

That he nearly had taken the use of me hip.

"2925" "The Old Orange Flute
In the county Tyrone, in the town of Dungannon
Where many a ruckus meself had a hand in
Bob Williamson lived there, a weaver by trade
And all of us thought him a stout-hearted blade.
On the twelfth of July as it yearly did come
Bob played on the flute to the sound of the drum
You can talk of your fiddles, your harp or your lute
But there's nothing could sound like the Old Orange Flute.
But the treacherous scoundrel, he took us all in
For he married a Papish named Bridget McGinn
Turned Papish himself and forsook the Old Cause
That gave us our freedom, religion and laws.
And the boys in the county made such a stir on it
They forced Bob to flee to the province of Connaught;
Took with him his wife and his fixins, to boot,
And along with the rest went the Old Orange Flute.
Each Sunday at mass, to atone for past deeds,
Bob said Paters and Aves and counted his beads
Till one Sunday morn, at the priest's own require
Bob went for to play with the flutes in the choir.
He went for to play with the flutes in the mass
But the instrument quivered and cried.\"O Alas!\"
And blow as he would, though he made a great noise,
The flute would play only \"The Protestant Boys\".
Bob jumped up and huffed, and was all in a flutter.
He pitched the old flute in the best holy water;
He thought that this charm would bring some other sound,
When he tried it again, it played \"Croppies Lie Down!\"
And for all he would finger and twiddle and blow
For to play Papish music, the flute would not go;
\"Kick the Pope\" to \"Boyne Water\" was all it would sound
Not one Papish bleat in it could e'er be found.
At a council of priests that was held the next day
They decided to banish the Old Flute away;
They couldn't knock heresy out of its head
So they bought Bob another to play in its stead.
And the Old Flute was doomed, and its fate was pathetic
'Twas fastened and burnt at the stake as heretic.
As the flames rose around it, you could hear a strange noise
'Twas the Old Flute still a-whistlin' \"The Protestant Boys\".

We landed in Salerno, a holiday with pay,
The Jerries brought the bands out to greet us on the way.
Showed us the sights and gave us tea,
We all sang songs, the beer was free
To welcome D-Day Dodgers to sunny Italy.
Naples and Casino were taken in our stride,
We didn't go to fight there, we went just for the ride.
Anzio and Sangro were just names,
We only went to look for dames
The artful D-Day Dodgers, way out in Italy.
Dear Lady Astor, you think you're mighty hot,
Standing on the platform, talking tommyrot.
You're England's sweetheart and her pride
We think your mouth's too bleeding wide.

You'll find the scattered crosses, some that have no name.
Heartbreak and toil and suffering gone,
The boys beneath them slumber on.

And the beer and whiskey flew and we all felt gay.
We visited McCann's, McLemann's, Humpty Dan's;
We then went into Swann's our stomachs for to pack.
We ordered out a feed, which indeed we did need
And we finished it with speed, but we still felt slack.
Johnny McEldoo turned red,white, and blue
[original seems to have been \"as blue as a Jew],
And a plate of Irish stew he soon put out of sight.
He shouted out \"Encore\" with a roar for some more
That he never felt before such a keen appetite.
He ordered eggs and ham, bread and jam, what a cram,
But him we couldn't ram though we tried our level best,
For everything we brought, cold or hot, mattered not
It went down him like a shot, and he still stood the test.
He swallowed tripe and lard by the yard. We got scared,
We thought it would go hard when the waiter brought the bill.
We told him to give o'er but he swore he could lo'er
Twice as much again and more before he had his fill.
He nearly sucked a trough full of broth. Says McGrath,
\"He'll devour the table cloth, if you don't hold him in.\"
When the waiter brought the charge McEldoo felt so large
He began to scowl and barge and his blood went on fire.
He began to curse and swear, tear his hair in despair,
And to finish the affair, called the shopman a liar.
The shopman he drew out and no doubt he did clout,
McEldoo he kicked about like an old football.
He tattered all his clothes, broke his nose, I suppose
He'd have killed him with a few blows in no time at all.
McEldoo began to howl and to growl by my soul,
He threw an empty bowl at the shopkeeper's head
It struck by Mickey Finn, peeled the skin off his chin,
And the ructions did begin and we all fought and bled.
The Peelers did arrive, man alive, four or five.
At us the made a drive, us all to march away.
We paid for all the meat that we ate, stood a treat,
And went home to ruminate on the spree that day.

The little craft abattling there
Against the icy blast
October's night brought such a sight
Twas never seen before
There were mast and yards and broken spars
A washing on the shore
There were many a heart in sorrow
Many a heart so brave
There were many a fine and hearty lad
That met a watery grave"
"2933" "1. The gypsy rover came over the hill
Down through the valley so shady,
He whistled and he sang 'til the green woods rang,
And he won the heart of a lady.
Ah-de-do, ah-de-do-da-day,
Ah-de-do, ah-de-da-day
he whistled and he sang 'til the green woods rang,
And he won the heart of a lady.
2. She left behind her velvet gown
and shoes made out of spanish lether
he whistled and he sang 'til the green woods rang,
To follow the gypsy rover.
3. Her father saddled up his fastest steed
And roamed the valleys all over
Sought his daughter at great speed
And the whistling gypsy rover.
4. He came at last to a mansion fine,
Down by the river Claydee
And there was music and there was wine,
For the gypsy and his lady.
5. \"He is no gypsy, father dear\"
\"But lord of these lands all over,
And I shall stay 'til my dying day
With my whistling gypsy rover.\""
"2934" "An Ulsterman I am proud to be
>From the Antrim Glens I come.
Although I labour by the sea
I have followed flag and drum.
I have heard the martial tramp of men
I've seen them fight and die.
Ah, lads, I well remember when
I followed Henry Joy.
I pulled my boat up from the sea
I hid my sails away,
I hung my nets on a greenwood tree
And I scanned the moonlit bay.
The boys were out, and the Redcoats too,
I kissed my wife goodbye;
And in the shade of the greenwood glade
I followed Henry Joy. \"
In Antrim town the tyrant stood,
He tore our ranks with ball,
But with a cheer and a pike to clear
We swept them o'er the wall.
Our pikes and sabres flushed that day,
We won, but lost, ah, why?
No matter lads, I fought beside
And shielded Henry Joy.
Ah, boys, for Ireland's cause we fought;
For her and home we bled,
Though our pikes were few still our hearts beat true,
And five to one lay dead,
And many a lassie mourned her lad,
And mother mourned her boy;
For youth was strong in that gallant throng
Who followed Henry Joy."
"2935" "I found my love 'neath the gasworks croft falls
Dreamed a dream by the old canal
Kissed my girl by the factory wall
Dirty old town, dirty old town
Clouds are drifting across the moon
Cats are prowling on their beat
Springs a girl in the streets at night
Dirty old town, dirty old town
Heard a siren from the dock
Saw a train set the night on fire
Smelled the spring on the smoky wind
Dirty old town, dirty old town
I'm going to take a good sharp ax
Shining steel tempered in the fire
We'll chop you down like an old dead tree
Dirty old town, dirty old town"

(Brain O'Higgins)
The policeman walked out, oh, so proud on his beat
When a vision came to him of stripes on his sleeve;
\"Promotion,\" he whispered, \"I'll try for today,
So its come with me Mister Ri-tooral-i-ay.\"
\"Come tell me your name,\" says the limb of the law
To the little fat man selling wares on the straw.
\"What's that, sir? Me name, sir? Why it's there on display
And it's Moses Ri-tooral-i-ooral-i-ay.\"
Now, the trial it came on and it lasted a week.
One judge said 'twas German; another, 'twas Greek-
\"Prove you're lrish,\" said the policeman \"and beyond it say nay;
And we'll sit on it, Moses Ri-tooral-i-ay.\"
Now the prisoner stepped up there as stiff as a crutch.
\"Are you lrish or English or German or Dutch?\"
\"I'm a Jew, sir; I'm a Jew, sir,\" that came over to stay.
And my name it is Moses Ri-tooral-i-ay.\"
\"We're two of a kind.\" said the judge to the Jew;
\"You're a cousin of Briscoe and I am one too.
This numbskull has blundered and for it will pay.\"
\"Wisha that's right,\" says Moses Ri-tooral-i-ay.
There's a garbage eollcctor who works down our strset;
He once was a policeman, the pride of his beat.
And he moans all the night and he groans all the day,
Singing,\" Moses Ri-tootal-i-ooral-i-ay. \"
Note: This reflects on the period when the Irish language was
outlawed in Ireland; the inability of the police to speak, or
even recognize the language presented enforcement problems.
Briscoe was Dublin's mayor. He was Jewish. (As the story
goes, \"only in America.\"

Come single belle and beau, to me now pay attention
And love, I'll plainly show, is the divil's own invention.
For once I fell in love with a damsel most bewitchin'
Miss Henrietta Bell, down in Captain Kelly's kitchen
cho:
To my toora loora la, my toora loora laddy
Ri toora loora la, ri toora loora laddy.
At the age of seventeen, I was 'prenticed to a grocer
Not far from Stephen's Green, where Miss Bell for tea would go, sir
Her manners were so free, she set me heart a-twitchin'
She invited me to tea, down in Captain Kelly's kitchen.
Next Sunday bein' the day we were to have the flare-up
I dressed myself quite gay, an' I frizzed and oiled my hair up
The Captain had no wife, he had gone out a-fishin'
So we kicked up high life, below-stairs in the kitchen.
Just as the clock struck six we sat down to the table
She served me tea and cakes --- I ate while I was able,
I ate cakes, drank punch and tea, till my side had got a stitch in
And the hours flew quick away, while coortin' in the kitchen.
With my arms around her waist, I kissed ---she hinted marriage
To the door in dreadful haste came Captain Kelly's carriage!
Her looks told me full well that moment she was wishin'
That I'd get out to Hell, or somewhere far from the kitchen.
She flew up off my knees, full seven feet or higher
And over heads and heels, threw me slap into the fire
My new Repealers coat, that I'd bought from Mrs. Stichen
With a thirty-shilling note, went to blazes in the kitchen.
I grieved to see my duds, all besmeared with smoke and ashes
When a tub of dirty suds, right in my face she dashes.
As I lay on the floor, still the water she kept pitchin'
Till the footman broke the door, and marched into the kitchen.
When the Captain came downstairs, and seen my situation
In spite of all my prayers I was marched off to the station
For me they'd take no bail, tho' to get home I was itchin'
And I had to tell the tale of how I got in the kitchen.
I said she did invite me, but she gave a flat denial
For assault she did indict me, and I was sent for trial.
She swore I robbed the house, in spite of all her screechin'
And I got six months hard, for my coortin' in the kitchen.

O'er bright May meadows of Shelmalier,

Spurred up the rocks with a warning cry;
\"Arm! Arm!\" he cried, \"for I've come to lead you,
For Ireland's freedom we fight or die.\"
He led us on 'gainst the coming soldiers,
The cowardly Yeomen we put to flight;
'Twas at the Harrow the boys of Wexford
Showed Bookey's regiment how men could fight.
Look out for hirelings, King George of England,
Search every kingdom where breathes a slave,
For Father Murphy of the County Wexford
Sweeps o'er the land like a mighty wave.
We took Camolin and Enniscorthy,
And Wexford storming drove out our foes;
'Twas at Slieve Coillte our pikes were reeking
With the crimson stream of the beaten yeos.
At Tubberneering and Ballyellis
Full many a Hessian lay in his gore;
Ah, Father Murphy, had aid come over,
The green flag floated from shore to shore!
At Vinegar Hill, o'er the pleasant Slaney,
Our heroes vainly stood back to back,
And the Yeos at Tullow took Father Murphy
And burned his body upon the rack.
God grant you glory, brave Father Murphy,
And open Heaven to all your men;
The cause that called you may call tomorrow
In another fight for the green again.

Dear Boss I write this note to you to tell you of my plight
And at the time of writing I am not a pretty sight
Me body is all black and blue and me face a deadly gray
And I hope you'll understand why Paddy's not at work today
I was workin' on the 14th floor; some bricks I had to clear
And throwin' 'em down from such a height was not a good idea
The foreman wasn't very pleased, he bein' an awful sod
And he said I'd have to take them down the ladder in me hod
Now shiftin' all those bricks by hand it seemed so awful slow
So I hoisted up a barrel and secured a rope below
But in my haste to do the job I was too blind to see
That a barrel full of buildin' bricks was heaveier than me
Now when I came down I cut the rope and the barrel fell like lead
And clinging tightly to the rope I started up instead
I shot up like a rocket and to my dismay I found
That halfways up I met the bloody barrel comin' down
Now the barrel broke me shoulder as to the ground it sped
And when I reached the top I struck the pulley with me head
I still clung on though numbed and shocked from this almighty blow
And the barrel spilled out half the bricks 14 floors below
Now when the bricks had fallen from the barrel to the floor
I then outweighed the barrel and I started down once more
Still clinging tightly to the rope I headed for the ground
And I fell among the broken bricks that were all scatter'd 'round
As I lay there moaning on the floor sure I thought I'd passed the worst
Then the barrel struck the pulley wheel and didn't the bottom burst
A shower of bricks came down on me sure I haven't got a hope
And as I was losing consciousness... I let go the bloody rope
Now the barrel it being heavier it started down once more
And it landed right across me as I lay there on the floor
I broke three ribs and my left arm and I can only say
That I hope you'll understand why Paddy's not at work today"

But the best is my herrings, fine Dublin Bay herrings,
There's herrings for dinner and tea.
I have a son, Mick, he's great on the flute,
He plays in the Longford Street band;
It would do your heart good for to see him march out
On a Sunday for Dollymount Strand.
cho:
In the park, on a Sunday, I make quite a dash;
The neighbors look on in surprise.
With my Aberdeen shawlie thrown over my head,
I dazzle the sight of their eyes.
At Patrick Street corner, for sixty-four years,
I've stood, and no one can deny
That while I stood there, nobody could dare
To say black was the white of my eye.

"2957" "The Men of the West
(William Rooney)
When you honor in song and in story
The names of the patriot men,
Whose valor has covered with glory
Full many a mountain and glen,
Forget not the boys of the heather
Who rallied their bravest and best
When Ireland was broken in Wexford
And looked for revenge to the West.
cho: I give you the gallant old West, boys,
Where rallied our bravest and best
When Ireland lay broken and bleeding;
Hurrah for the men of the West!
The hilltops with glory were glowing
'Twas the eve of a bright harvest day,
When the ship we'd been wearily waiting
Sailed into Killala's broad bay.
And over the hills went the slogan
To awaken in every breast
The fire that has never been quenched, boys,
Among the true hearts of the West.
cho:
Killala was ours ere the midnight,
And high over Ballina town
Our banners in triumph were waving
Before the next sun had gone down.
We gathered to speed the good work, boys
The true men from near and afar;
And history can tell how we routed
The redcoats through old Castlebar.
cho:
And pledge me the stout sons of France, boys,
Bold Humbert and all his brave men,
Whose tramp, like the trumpet of battle,
Brought hope to the drooping again.
Since Ireland has caught to her bosom
On many a mountain and hill
The gallants who fell, so they're here, boys,
To cheer us to victory still.
cho:
Though all the bright dreamings we cherished
Went down in disaster and woe,
The spirit of old is still with us
That never would bend to the foe.
And Connaught is ready whenever
The loud rolling tuck of the drum
Rings out to awaken the echoes
And tell us the morning has come.

My sad heart strove the two between, the old love and the new love
The old for her, the new that made me think on Ireland dearly
While soft the wind blew down the glen and shook the golden barley
'Twas hard the woeful words to frame to break the ties that bound us
But harder still to bear the shame of foreign chains around us
And so I said, \"The mountain glen I'll seek at morning early
And join the bold united men, while soft winds shake the barley\"
While sad I kissed away her tears, my fond arms round her flinging
The foeman's shot burst on our ears from out the wildwood ringing
A bullet pierced my true love's side in life's young spring so early
And on my breast in blood she died while soft winds shook the barley
But blood for blood without remorse I've taken at Oulart Hollow
And laid my true love's clay cold corpse where I full soon may follow
As round her grave I wander drear, noon, night and morning early
With breaking heart when e'er I hear the wind that shakes the barley"

There Ireland's lines of marching men, in squadron passed me by
No pipes did hum or no battle drum did sound its dread tattoo
But, the Angelus bell o'er the Liffey swell, rang out in the Foggy Dew
Right proudly high over Dublin town, they hung out the flag of war
For, 'twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky than at Suvla or Sud El Bar
And from the plains of Royal Meath, strong men came hurrying through
While Brittania's sons with their long range guns, sailed in by the Foggy Dew
'Twas England bade our wild geese go that small nations might be free
But, their lonely graves are by Suvla's waves on the fringe of the grey North Sea
Oh, had they died by Pearse's side, or fought with Valera true
Their graves we'd keep where the Fenians sleep, 'neath the hills of the Foggy Dew
The bravest fell and the sullen bell rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Easter tide in the springing of the year
And the world did gaze in deep amaze at those fearless men and true
Who bore the fight that freedom's light might shine through the Foggy Dew"

To raise up the memory of his dear native land
At a fair or a wake, I could twist my shillelagh
Or trip through a jig with my brogues bound with straw
And all the pretty colleens around me assembled
Loved their bold Phelim Brady, the bard of Armagh
Oh, how I long to muse on the days of my boyhood
But four score and three years have flitted since then
But they bring sweet reflections, as every young joy should
For, the merry hearted boys makes the best of old men

And a couple of two or three went on the spree one day
We had a bob or two, which we knew how to blew
And the beer and whiskey flew and we all felt gay
We visited McCann's, Maclaman's, Humpty Dan's
We then went into Swan's, our stomachs for to pack
We ordered out a feed, which indeed, we did need
And we finished it with speed, but we still felt slack
Johnny McEldoo turned red, white and blue
As a plate of Irish stew he soon put out of sight
He shouted out \"Encore!\" with a roar for some more
That he'd never felt before such a keen appetite
We ordered eggs and ham, bread and jam, what a cram
But him, we couldn't ram, though we tried our level best
For everything we brought, cold or hot, mattered not
It went down him like a shot and he still stood the test
He swallowed tripe and lard by the yard, we got scarred
We thought it would go hard when the waiter brought the bill
We told him to give o'er, but he swore he could lower
Twice as much again and more before he had his fill
He nearly supped a trough full of broth says McGragh
\"He'll devour the tablecloth if you don't hold him in\"
When the waiter brought the charge, McEldoo felt so large
He began to shout and barge and his blood went on fire
He began to curse and swear, tear his hair in despair
To finish the affair, called the shop man a liar
The shop man, he through out and no doubt, he did clout
McEldoo he kicked about like an old football
Tattered all his clothes, broke his nose, I suppose
He would have killed him with a few blows in no time at all
Mceldoo began to howl and to growl, by my soul
Through an empty bowl at the shop keepers head
It struck poor Mickey Flynn, took the skin from his chin
An erection did begin and we all fought and bled
The peelers did arrive, man alive, four or five
At us they made a dive for us all to march away
We paid for all the mate that we ate, stood a trait

And many a wealthy nobleman before him shook with fear
It was Brennan on the moor, Brennan on the moor
Bold, brave and undaunted was young Brennan on the moor
One day upon the highway as young Willie he went down
He met the mayor of Cashiell a mile outside of town
The mayor he knew his features and he said, Young man, said he
Your name is Willie Brennan, you must come along with me
Now Brennan's wife had gone to town provisions for to buy
And when she saw her Willie she commenced to weep and cry
Said, Hand to me that tenpenny, as soon as Willie spoke
She handed him a blunderbuss from underneath her cloak
Now with this loaded blunderbuss - the truth I will unfold -
He made the mayor to tremble and he robbed him of his gold
One hundred pounds was offered for his apprehension there
So he, with horse and saddle to the mountains did repair
Now Brennan being an outlaw upon the mountains high
With cavalry and infantry to take him they did try
He laughed at them with scorn until at last 'twas said
By a false-hearted woman he was cruelly betrayed
They hanged Brennan at the crossroads, in chains he hung and dried
But still they say that, in the night, some do see him ride
They see him with his blunderbuss, all in the midnight chill
Along, along the King's highway rides Willie Brennan still!"

Lo que traiba en su cintura era una pistola escuadra
Robaba y mataba gente porque as se diverta
Su cabeza tenia precio, Quincemil pesos vala
Juan Marta era aguerrido, temido por el gobierno
Sus rivales le teman como si fuera veneno
Su madrecita lloraba, lloraba y se los deca
Si me dieran libre a mijo, quincemil pesos dara
Ya no llores madrecita, no te ests atormentando
Que de cien vidas que debo, con una la estoy pagando
Ya no llores madrecita, ya no les ofrezcas nada
Que llegando aquel cerrito yo me rindo de la jornada
Esta noche con la luna

Me van a quitar la vida sea por el amor de dios
Ya con esta me despido pero les dejo un a carta

montado a caballo,

Era hombre ranchero,
de mucho dinero,
de aquellos hombres cabales.
Tena cinco establos,
bastante ganado,
y muchas tierras de riego.
Por eso temprano,
paseaba a caballo,
perdindose en sus terrenos.
Pero las mujeres,
fueron su desgracia,
quien iba a pensarlo,
que en una aventura,
Domingo Corrales,
la vida perdiera.

Domingo Corrales,
andaba borracho,
las fiestas se celebraban,
Rayando el caballo,
frente de la plaza,
la gente se amontonaba.
La reina del pueblo,
llamada Gardenia,
al verla le haba gustado.
Y supo robarla,
con pistola en mano,
en ancas de su caballo.
Pero en un barranco,
cuando iban corriendo,
se fueron cayendo,
rodando y rondando,
los dos se mataron,
con todo y caballo."

Me lo avisa el corazon
Aaaayyyyyy Hhhhhhaaaaahhhaaa!
Lucio te van a matar
Montaron en sus caballos rumbo a la sierra mojada cuando llegaron al baile
Ya su rival lo esperaba
Lo invitaron a unas copas Lucio no quiso aceptar
Se hicieron de unas palabras para salirse a pelear
Le dieron tres pualadas de la espalda al corazon
Como le decia su madre Lo mataron a traicion

Callo en la peor envoscada

Que su madre muy valiente
Le dio de asotes al cuerpo
Dis que por desobediente

De aquel cuerpo sin sentido
Lloraba lagrimas gruesas
Como si estuviera vivo

En eso heredo a su madre

"3135" "Nadie es eterno en el mundo
Ni teniendo un corazon
Que tanto siente why suspira
Por la vida why el amor
Todo lo acaban los anos
Dime que te llevas tu
Si con el tiempo no queda
Ni la tumba ni la cruz
Cuando ustedes me esten despidiendo
Con el ultimo adios de este mundo
Nome lloren que nadie es eterno
Nadie vuelve del sueno profundo
Sufriras, lloraras
Mientras te acostumbras a perder
Despues te resignaras
Cuando ya no me vuelvas a ver
Adios a los que se quedan
Siempre les quize cantar
Suerte why que la gozen mucho
Ya no hay tiempo de llorar
No lloren por el que muere
Que para siempre se va
Lloren por el que se queda
Si lo quieren ayudar
Cuando ustedes me esten despidiendo
Con el ultimo adios de este mundo
Nome lloren que nadie es eterno
Nadie vuelve del sueno profundo
Sufriras, lloraras
Mientras te acostumbras a perder
Despues te resignaras
Cuando ya no me vuelvas a ver"
"3136" "Estamos otra vez
En el mismo lugar
Sufriendo por lo mismo
Why cuando vas a parar
Sufriendo un corazon
Te dedicaste a enganar
Se que vas a llorar
Tenemos mala suerte
En cosas del amor
Tenemos que ser fuertes
Why aguantar el dolor
Tienes que reponerte
Why volverte a enamorar
O te voy a cambiar
why voy a mandarme hacer
Un corazon de oropel
Para que aguante todo
Lo que le quieras hacer
Fallamos corazon
Volvimos a perder
No lo puedo creer
Yo fui muy limpio why sano
En cosas del amor
Yo a ti te di la mano
Te di besos why calor
Tu en cambio me enganaste
Me causaste dolor
Me saliste la peor
Tenemos mala suerte
En cosas del amor
Tenemos que ser fuertes
Why aguantar el dolor
Tienes que reponerte
Why volverte a enamorar
O te voy a cambiar
why voy a mandarme hacer

And the histories are full of blinking
And blurs
I am hidden when the inken bird covers
My youth and my back
I was not there for you in the panic
I was not there as the kitten died
And I take this home with me
I swallow your pain and stick blood into me
Suck moss and needles, the faces of burrs
The methodical false twilight
And the gossip poured love like greedy beads
Like mirrors I am your face
In the toilet in the kittenchen
On the glassblue sea the birds see
I am your mirror
Your echo is me
In bells and birds that beauty I saw
Etched in clouds trailing
Making curtains of waves
The broken face peeps
He echoes \"I am echo\"
I see you monster
I see you monster
My back and jaw hunch and feel
You there
You are the cuckoo, the train, the muffled drum
You say, \"I am echo
I am cleaner of floors
Sower of sores\"
And policeman in brambles and bubbles
Call the beauty to rest
Say, \"I am echo\"
And rise with peacocks
Feral and horizon
The beauty moved over me
And the beauty crashed down over my body
With wine and dreams creeping down from the bookcases
And saying \"I am echo; I am you; speak me; release me;
Kill me and leave the cat to G+D and rain and pussy willows\"
Falling like paws and snowing tears and the voice Shuts silent liar"
"3145" "Adam stands on docetic mountain
The woman's face is full of stars
In the words of the book
And with the lips of the book
And the trumpet and the seal
And the candlestick that lights
Up your bed with seeds and flowers
And the lion on your rug
That's roaring like a lamb
On the rack and on its back
I call the martyrs on wheels
To this piss-poor mess
And the blood spreading like flies
Under the table and the gable
Breathing curtains of eyes
That shift uneasily
And sniff like foxes at count
With feathers following the mind
That stitches quilts
And pours cats into comets
Oh microwave oh galaxy kill
All the night and its names
On docetic drawn mountain
My dragon arises
Scaling plastic Christs
With no back and no face
He has stolen space
And has solemn to spare
And kisses mountains
Covered with useless snow
For Paise and for Thekla
Under low volcanoes
Fearful wails to fall
Under his brothers
And Bloodface kills again
And smothers the wheels
Drawing in the dirt
There is Ashkai
Under psychic attack since eight
I saw the bells by the jar
I saw the teeth in the jaw
And saw the pale drains
Mind sinking empty wine
Useless in the heathen Eden
How great was the jungle
Dogs clutch heads and
Catch and call fall bulls
Murmuring like lovely streams
That pulse and hurtle
My clock shot shut"
"3146" "Anyway murder they say
Please murder
My face was watching braille dogs
Hammering out belonging to the sky
Their wings form shutters
From Alan's window
The incense drifts past the skins and shells
Ruby waves goodbye
And runs to the valleys
That are beautiful
And drenched with rain and colours
And green was that blood then
The sap of monsoons and butterflies
When I was small the red flowers opened
And I broke letters and dreamed
Or murder and nations and Crowley's jazz
4 or 5 decades later
I am some Egyptian face
Was I in Luxor carving my name?
Was I binding cats with kindness and saws?
The green glass stinks with ash
In the broken windows
Remembered bodies
Fill the streets with novels
And the brave boys pass by
In brave pontoons
And mark graves
With pebbles that sink and shriek jingles
What was the lie in your showboat?
Or your slowboat? Were the paperweights
Calling you to statis? Or murder?
Was your soul at KostKutters or Kwiksavers?
The cats lie under pink lights
And see themselves as ponies with fur
Whilst Judas arises 4 centuries too late
And says ecce homo an
I was not the creator at the dawn or evening
But the trains walk by to Toytown
And call for fares from the wooden front
You and I were walking the calypso
Howling for teatime
At teatime the conquistadors and matadors
Are salvators and astronauts
The sea was bloody red and coupled with fury
Anyway murder they say
Anyway murder"
"3147" "These are the dregs
Of last grains of the age
May be the hourglass
Of earth covering earth
But not in Betlehem
Not in Jerusalem
Not in Chorazin
And not in Bethsaida
We will not again see
God humbled on an ass
But see -
See
On a white horse he comes
Blazing sword
In, in burning hand
''Lo, I am become death
The destroyer of worlds''
His hands are backed up
They're straining at his neck
What colour shall we rank in him?
What face shall we deliver him?
There may be the black dog
There may be the white dog
Hitler comes as Kalki
Kalki comes as Hitler
Teeth! Teeth! Teeth! Teeth!
But meaningless lights
Still hold our attention
We think that the holy books
Are written in blood and fire
But what if it's water?
The fire's turned to blood
The blood's turned to water
And the water's turned to what?
Milk? Piss? Lies? Dust?
Hitler comes as Kalki
Kalki comes as Hitler
everything becomes emptiness
but goes through fire
secret mother (gsang yum chen mo)
secret father (gsang yab chen po)
Hitler becomes Kalki
Kalki becomes Hitler
White horse and red horse
Christ twists on the cross
Hitler smiles in the guttering rubble
He brings not peace but a sword
And maybe the ocean roars immaculate
Maybe the stars fall incomprehensible
Oh these all tell me
Oh these all spell to me
Hitler as Kalki
Kalki as Hitler
Where's your God now?
I'll point out his varied forms to you:
One: he hangs on the end of a tree
Two: he's nailed to the arms
Of this self-same tree
And three: he spins and soars
And laughs through space!
One day the world sees
Oh, one day the world sees
Hitler as Kalki
Kalki as Hitler
And he lies matted
Half in time and half in space
Through the rising incense smoke
I see him in the crowded room
I see him crossing the mountain range
If we see man at his most bloody
If we see man at his most base
Shall we point then and there say
''This is reality, this is his nature''?
Oh, what makes the pain
More real than the joy?
Both are so mingled now
And muddled together
To pull them apart
We butcher the essence
And cripple its meaning
God is on the cross
Or three gods perhaps
If they are all one
Neither coming nor going
Neither waxing nor waning
But immense in their unity
Matter and space
He rides between the spaces
And he rides between the pain
In the secret heart of becoming
In the secret modes of darkness
His eyes are now shuttered windows
Oh, man man man man
With his claws and his lies
With his peace and his pain
With his love and his sorrow
With his candle of hope
That stutters and dies
No liberation through hearing
When the sound of the world's collapsing
Deafens deafens deafens our ears
And pierces our heart
Hitler as Kalki
Kalki as Hitler
Rolling and roaring
Swooping and soaring
Exultant and trembling
Sorrow sorrow sorrow
Where the eagle flies
Where the eagle shudders
Where the eagle drops
Where the eagle plummets
All things merging
And all things dissolving
Then stars collapse
The vortex commences in space
The rubble collects
The debris gathers
Time starts to shiver
My heart's blood
If I dissolve into your body
If I hoped to find
Whitelight in your soul
If together we fall into forever
Would we not notice the turbulence
That no longer waits?
First he comes
From on a hill
Then he's running
Throughout the town
Then he stands
Devoid of peace
Devoid of place
Devoid of pity
Oh my dear Christ
Carried broken from sad brown earth
Teeth. Teeth. Teeth. Teeth. Teeth.
Hitler as Kalki
Kalki as Hitler"
"3148" "I
Behind my walls are my Cats. And behind my Cats is a Peacock singing to me of my death and yours. I said to her \"In the silence of an eye, I shall smile and arise, and see someone I used to know sleeping; in her room in her bed in her body I was in Paradise.\" I am awake in the sound of roses and a young girl's voice. We are drowning in the approaching shadows. I am dreaming and cannot hold it. I have seen.
(Dear Christ: the silence and the loss; we are born and fall. Dear Christ, you too are broken and lost and hanging like a Roman standard over us all.)

Behind the line of my skull that hides behind my hair and skin, I see the selfsame skull of my father, and beyond the skull of my father, the skull of my grandfather, and the skull of my great grandfather, whom I never knew. And so on this line unto the alpha and omega point at infinity. With my eye - this fire, this fly, that sees everything and smiles, and comprehends nothing, and dies - I see all around my head and that end. I have invented myself; I have created myself; I am just a form of dream English, words stretched with skin and fear. From my eyes in my skull my father observes this immense and kaleidoscopic dream. By birth I am other than this. The mosquitoes rejoice in my skin. The lizard is on the ceiling above me. The shallow water pots deny the ants routes to food. There is no silence ever. The cicadas are omnipotent sound. The kampong is dark and still. I am not what I thought I was. I am not what I seem. Most of all, I am not what I am. I thought it was the news rushing down the wires, happy in death and fashion, spinning yo-yos and clacking its jaw, raising its eyes, mimicking dogs at play. The sun shuts down, and erases birdlight. And in this stunted eclipse I saw myself, some darkness at last tenously visible, love as the sweetest thing. Al Bowlly, Jack Buchanan, sing on, dreaming of the lamps and the beautiful ladies, bowed lips packed with blood, the staged kisses trembling under the placid stars, the coffee taken with cream and scones under the Viennese Moon; whilst we are weighed, we are judged, and twist in this storm like birds over sails.
III
I have caught the dead again: I click my eyes
And there they are, mercurial ghosts, formed
And moving; so the dead do move, and shout,
And pray, and cry, and suffer
And the eye click on and one: the one shut
Catches the dead. The clouds pass by.
God hovers over us and shrieks
We don't hear the slightest crackle
Can't see the slightest smiles
And we blur into our death and the second great death
Whilst we chase chicks and dream of a paradise without wings or sorrow, Christ's tears fall over Jerusalem. The curtains are groggy with damp, and the rails, and the tracks and the tacks, and the black and the bats, and the shrivelled shrill lights trip and laugh over the weeds and the blossoms, and throats open shut and sigh. I am the moon and the sun, the rising and the setting, the first and final breaths, and the product of the stars. I am some immortal and pointless dust.
Two bodies lie in bed for their brief moment together in eternity; the memory holds still; we watch the fireflies kiss the night and turn their backs on the Milky Way forever, as our eyes shower sweetness upon each other.
IV
I caught a glimpse of your eyes
Last night in a restless dream
Awaking out of green field blue seas stars
Your eyes arose like the spectres of flowers
I turned out the light and clicked fast the door
The book fell
I had so many thoughts, so many signs
I made sense of nothing at all
This green dream was unreal; the crickets sing
Across deserts and plains the lost feast
Whose shimmering teeth are marking the passing of time
A cloud falls; a bird shivers and sings, its beak stained with night
Pure gold: the dark is waiting, the darkness is hungry,
The deep is angry, and the telephone rings on
A film screen descends, and the silent movies play
Buster Keaton falls and rots, as Big Ben sings and boils
On an endless swamp; the silence is treacle thick
And calls us to prayer: paint God with your blood
And fill haunted women with knives and kites
And gauges and valves and make them weep long hymns
To gaseous and clumsy mortality whilst fish descend
Remember, remember the burning ember
Embedded in your chest: the soul watches TV
And gorges itself on blood and popcorn
Now that's what I call decay decline and hard times
Hard times, very hard times, Mr. Lindsay,
Hard times and winter so croool: you have stopped my watch
At the stroke of three and call for the police
But there's a time for tea and a time for expiring
And the notice to quit is in the post:
And you should know: your
Little cow and calf is gonna die
V
I was awake, dreaming
Of new dystopias to run to and hide within
And new faces to wear
And new bodies to inhabit
And new lies to guzzle
And how I loved
The moon, and its sheets of seeds
The moon tiding in your body
The smell of your blood breathing
And its taste in the sea in the south shining my feet
Till it seemed as if they were made of dew
With pearls of huge beauty
Whilst your mouselike breath was
The hand upon my clock
And one each breath I came nearer
To my silly and shining end
VI
All long summer long
Under the fly-dance and the thumbthick twilight
The thought of you smiling
And laughing with children
Crippled me
Typecast and forlorn
Smudged ghost gorgeous:
There is a love so profound
So broken and risen:
Torment, black valley
Slumbering between our lips
And the lies we thoughtlessly wove
I knew your essence once
At our time when the sunset and I touched you
In the slanting room, just south of the past
Between your belly and thighs:
This was a temporary deceitful paradise.
Lost as we created it
And destroyed in tasting
So much blood is lacking now
I dreamt for your bit lips, haunted like waves
In the ecstatic arch of evening:
You and the night, you and the mountain
You and tomorrow, you and the tomorrow:
Stay away: stay away: stay away:
What we want we cannot have
And wanting all the more
I slept on words and lines and texts
Of useless want, staring at the time
And finally lost you finally finally lost you finally
As the moon swept down and wept.
VII
Good morning: How are you?
I have called to say
I saw you dreaming of conquests
Of large wars, bigger walls:
But:
I am pleased to say:
Your houses are dead
Your children are full of flame
The horses are dead and the butterflies fall
God is abroad
The wind is in the air
And from the depths
I point at us all
Good morning
The clouds of smoke arise
Arise arise full of eyes of eyes
Your sons are suffocating their sisters
And painting eyes on the walls
With tongues dipped in blood
Arise arise full of eyes of eyes
And from the depths
I call to us all
Good morning
I have seen the face that lies
I have seen the lips that smile
With false smiles arise arise
Look look: I have read a book a book
That has spelt out the future
And from the depths
I see a king arise arise
With on his forehead many eyes eyes
And he is on a horse a horse a horse
With a train of smoke behind its hooves
And I must say from my depths
I have seen a story emerge from a cloud of wings
Arise arise from eyes from eyes
And a number is sss6een is sss6een is sss6een
From the depths beauty
And from the depths loss
From the depths from the depths
I have called and added and have seen you all
Your children are dead and waiting for you
VIII
The sun has already just set
You said
And behind it the moondfaced disc
Blue; pearl; white: opaline mouth
Sack of hopes, of dreams, of fur
Catching the moths that
Trail dust in the dusk
Caused you to open alone and sign
Goodbye to us all in the white room
In the eyewhite, skullwhite room
In the bed,
Amongst the dead:
Santa Rita, ora pro nobis
I looked at you
And touched the earth
Hid under concrete and cruelty
Credo quia impossibile est
That the dead rise, rise, rise
And in the blink, in the twink
Of your eye, Santa Rita,
I saw you dart, dark as an eclipse
Whilst the twilight made a rainbow
All around your passing
And I saw and was saved
IX
In dream:
You are there
As the tip of the tongue collapses towards the teeth
And the waters of dream mass around
You are there: You are there
Suddenly and silently
You are the force of the wave
And birds, all birds, reel in the distance
Their face at dawn
Where profound and terrible armies surge
And foreign towns collapse under the weight of prophesied terrors
All the dead advance, great armies,
Martyrs for the Blood, the Sign, the Wound
And time
The animals all sorted Fishes too
I have eaten judge me at
God's right hand
And the cats that arise from the dirt and the filth
And the starving and the scabby
The tortured the tortured the tortured
I see them at night before I drift
During my sleep they gambol and play
And chase Balls or Children or Giants
They play cards and click their eyes
They laugh, and take tea at six
They laugh as they tumble
And have TEETH the size of cloudbursts
And grip us and take us down to the Deep
And we sigh and expire and
seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
silenceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
sssssssssmilliiiiiiiiiiiiinggggggggggggggg
I cannot bear this all any more. Not enough silence. But in the desert I sometimes see ships and hear the black diamond express near the station before mine. Caesar: where are you going? He said to me, grinning:
You will reach the Kingdom
With a bow and a sweep
You will reach the Kingdom
I have caught and tortured Time
And I ARISE
We are surrounded for the last 2000 years by a VAST EMPIRE OF DEATH and EMPIRE OF BLOOD: this was all after the Crucifixion:
i uflow tou yeou: plhrhw xaritow kai elhyeiaw.
So try to remove whatever may dream or spill or seed or spread on your breath:
Or your silence will seep into the something you wished to avoid
It will be seen some fine day, all right, yes, all right:
\"I will make you mine,\", just you and I, whilst our breaths pass between us and spiral off to mausoleums of desires and hopes.
When my friends pass into the great goodbye before my eyes
And I too move with them: without sound, just words
Left floating through the streets, and the ears:
And the souls of the people who were with me: I was in them
And they were in me. And off they go, a pint in their hands,
A glint in their eye, and I see tambourines drearily clapping out
The pavine carnival march: \"now you see'em, now you don't\"
I did not want the world to stop; and I have seen it rush past me
As a ferocious fury, but such angelic fury, and I was taking the Temperature of a thousand changes of mind: I might take you now, but perhaps I shall wait till the postman comes for toast and - With notes of the obsequies at 12 -
With your teeth on edge at the faint sound of the swans charging at the trees that you built swings on and killed under and dreamt under
With your beloved in that first and last virginal Summer
When you entered this world of blood and belief
And coupled under the Tropical Sun
And gave birth to children in your cries
I am born to die.
I am born to die.
I am born to die.
\"Jesus snorted; he was moved to his guts;\" and the dust was everywhere, and Pilate arose in his fury. You have a boat waiting, friend, and it is time to board: all aboard, all aboard. \"We don't save the living here.\" (The cyclamen opens at evening, and the world was gentle tonight; summery, hints of rose and rouge in the sky in the north over the dome of the glassgreenhouse.) Pilate arose. And washed his hands. I washed my hands; I cleared dust of them; I can see specks of blood laughing upon them. Pilate washes his hands. He arose and washed his hands. And the sword fell.
Meanwhile, in the house with nothing at home: in the cafe with plates of liver and kidneys and offal; in the slaughterhouse near the schoolyard; in the damaged rooms of the schoold ma'am at rest; in the fallen arches of the brilliant silence, coloured at dawn, and twilit by the twittering of birds; in the moon shining down on the shrew on my step; at the freshly cut grass; at the sound of the bell making toast or tea or time buzz by with loud whoops of shouting \"I am here I am there; catch me if you can, catch me if you dare\". At all th4ese moments, and all these daydreams, and all our breaths which dream idly into deaths, deaths: at all these deaths, I remember you beautiful with love and fear with swooping hair biting the words our of your mind, and delivering them to me hating to pass the time, which swept by, as proud as a ghost, whilst we tossed coins to see who would disappear first."
"3149" "And then when then I die
I feel I shall say
I have not understood
I have not understood any of this
My eyes are still coaldark
I have not understood
Around and in my eyes the tiny flecks
Of swirling crippled confused lights
And to my heart I will whisper
Softly quietly
\"There is no death there is no death\"
(And goodbye to you all)
Under the gorgon grinned arches
Of London's great vaults
I have not understood
Under the sunpuckered roofs
Of Kathmandu
I have not understood
Along the soulstoned streets
Of Lower
And of Higher Germanie
I have not understood
Leipzig: blackeyed pain and loss: she
I have not understood
In Clare near I
the empty lakes are open in the distance
And too close is the famineretchingroad
All these are ghosts
There I have not understood
(In the Heart of the Wood
Oh there I have understood)
I rested at the temple of Great Black Time -- Her
And did not understand
Though animalbled fleshmarbled rivers ran in Her honour
His buckled body in blood
Returns to the prebirth poise
Spreadeagled like starfish --
There in His eyes:
Incomprehension mute pain disbelief what
Blood there meant sorrow trickles there
This I could not understand
I bend the pages of yet another book
And in its lines Great Black Lines
I have not understood
Please gramercy pray for me
And oh goodbye sweetestheart
The wind roars in the nearness
And there in my heart
And all the clouds are spiralling towards us
Descent indeed to the centre of it all
Skipping lightly and lying truly
This we shall understand
I hope...
We bent humped trees
The great ones -- there
On the lapped shore
Dai Ichi
There also I do not know
This is all unknowable
And as the dust covers
My empty eyes
You shall read in these foolish gapes
Oh that I have not understood
(But if you look for the stag and cross conjoined
there on my arm look there
There I have understood very well.)
Now you are all fading
All fading
As my age creeps on
As This Age stumbles on
Fires in the earth
Fires in the sky
Fires in our hearts
Fires everywhere
The black eyes
Already blacken
And this I have not understood
Not peace
But a sword
This and He
Unfortunately
I have understood
Under the bowered greenwood tree
When first I lay
Bright starre with Thee
Under the velvet branches dear
When sun and moon both came so near
Under the starlit open dome
Under the starsharp pointed lights
Under the starloved greeny earth
When first I wanted to hold You
And all the world halfdead and halflive
Spat into my mouth
Bluesea bitterwater
And I am almost dead
And I have not understood
Under the rain and teeth of gods
Under the pain and sleeping liddy eyes
Under the brokkèd wetful heaven
If you are there
If you are there
If you are there
Then I am singing with my eyes
If you are there"
"3150" "So: this Empire is nothing
Before me the green fields are stretched out
The broken body of a cat glows there
And the shimmering flies fall
This Empire is nothing

This Empire is not real
I cannot hang words on the Silence
Everywhere God's goldenlight
S. said: \"You have appeared to me for a reason\"
And I said to Her:
\"Who do You say I am?\"
Like One better before"

I hold a black mirror in my hands

Their arms the nightbreath sleepwalking
The sighing of imminence and ending
All there the waves curl under and over
Around me: I see things coming to a close
The door is /nearly/ shut
As we stare at it the tinylight squeaks out
Slower and slower
I see things coming to a close
The folding cerecloth shrugs down over the windows
The lights burn still: but /invisible/ to us now
I see things coming to a close

I dreamt
I cannot see
I cannot see
I can no longer see
And nor would I want to
Anymore

Goaway
The pale toothed face inverted
At the feet of the /Rose Garden/
By the hedge and by the dream
By the post and by the bell
By the dawn and by the form
(/Formless He Lay and Dreamt/)
And formless we lay and shall dream
And then the rain
\"My pain beneath your sheltering hand\"
He cried
And gave himself up to the Tempter
The rebel angels (he thought and knew)
Would indeed array him with robes of water
But not mad
But clear
Why can't we all just walk away?"
"3152" "Circles within circles
We ride through them all
Circles within circles
\"In the midst of the Southern regions...\"
There a man rests and weeps
This year, next year,
Sometimes,
Never, oh never
If we think then that there is
No joy
But listen:
On the edge of winds
Is the rustling of the greens
All many greens, manifold and lovely
The sighing and crying of the wind
The lovely boughs
The lovely light
The lovely light
The lovely stars, jewelly nobles
The pitted starheads of a burning fire
Burn far brighter burn brighter --
Starry glory golden flamey and lambent --
Than any other fires we know
The moony wetmouthed cradle of bluenight
The plumed bird, lovely voiced
The streaked cat, rooted hairshine
Head of furlight
Purr of bright sound
Lovely and noble, jewelly lords
So sparkling, glimmering spitting lights
Little houses of fire
In little towns of fire
Open and shut their fiery sandsheet eyes"
"3153" "We've got a farm, a barn of a farm
Right in the middle of a swamp
There ain't any charm in our little farm
Right in the middle of the swamp
Now nothing's grown since the day we came
Misery Farm is our farm's name!
We're all miserable, so miserable
Down on Misery Farm
So are the animals, so are the vegetables
Down on Misery Farm
The hens won't lay, we can't make hay
We work all day, we get no pay!
We're all miserable, so miserable
Down on Misery Farm
Now we've got a cart, with part of the cart
Stuck in the middle of the swamp
The old grey mare, she looks at it there
Stuck in the middle of the swamp
We'll be digging it out next May
Patching it up for Darby day!
We're miserable, so miserable
Down on Misery Farm
So are the animals, so are the vegetables
Down on Misery Farm
The hens won't lay, We can't make hay
We work all day and we get no pay!
We're miserable, so miserable
Down on Misery Farm
We're miserable, so miserable

"3154" "In the mind of god
The dead sleeping lie
And the little cogs though unmoving

We have slept before and shall sleep again

I say liars
Liars
Liars you are
Over the starry dancing stars
There is a land
Under the sweatribbed brow
There is a land
And this is the globed world of the Pantocrator
Finally I have understood
I have understood
I have understood
Though when I slip sleeping and silently
From this ribbed room of sighs
You shall not find the history of His personal visit
Sewn into my linings perhaps
Nevertheless I have understood
Where the logician watches god hinge all on a die
Nevertheless: I have understood!
That all this is the breathbetween moment
Our eyelids open and close
Between is the land
Between the time I first was accepted
In between Your brightboned body
Between then and there and the time You wept:
\"Goodbye my love goodbye to you\"
Goodbye oh goodbye
There there was the land
In the pearls of our heart
There is the immaculate heavenly loveland
In the middle of the forest Actæon is slain by his own hounds
In the middle of the forest Eustace meets the crisscross Stag
There is the land he has reached paradise
There is no death
There is no death
There as the stag turns and smiled loved
There he was takencaught by the prey
All the flowers are blossoming
And all the world calls to you:
\"Dormition\" -- so you sleep
\"Dominion\" -- so he rules
Dormition -- oh You sleep, Mother
Dominion -- Father, You rule"

Suckled lovewing mine
You were
I was not yet dressed Tibetan red
And into You, as You'll recall
I fled

Is rolling and waving
Wolf wild wide wind walking
Soft smoke star space stalking

We have waited for
And not believed in
Oh nearly not at all
Oh nearly not at all
Once when we were young
Oh once we were so young
And the rainways licking the glass
Made us the observers of the distant distance
We there watched the sky's goddy tears
Only once did GoodGod cry black
And then all the clockmovements start
To crick crack crick
By the hairs on my head
By the stare in my eyes
By the pain in my heart
I shall whisper through signs:
All this world makes great blood
All this world makes great blood
All this world makes great blood
All this world makes great blood
All this world makes great blood
All this world makes great blood

\"The old willows wrecked again and again in the hold of the woods held
in close confinement all round into the struggle for existance where
the streams were constantly taken from their course by the roots of the
old trees in the woods allowing no mill stream the free course through
until the whole of these fine old trees had got their whole water
course directed by their own roots into each others roots in their own
devious ways & so each time the bad weather conditions came the dell of
the old popular willows received the whole rainfall & gave the roots of
the old popular trees the worst conditions they could not recover from.
The result was when the bad storms swept the ground downhill the whole
of the upright branches of the populars were wrecked & wrenched off as
none had sufficient root hold to do any good in holding as against the
winds forcing both root & trunks & branches to give way. The ultimate
result was as stated the cracking down of the branches & the breaking
off of the main trunk as it had no side branches to help its leaves to
support the whole tree. This gave the stubble growth of enforcing the
trunk low down near the ground to spray out the small side branches &
to develope in the trunk the further strength to enlarge the top of the
trunk to enable the heavy branch growth to develop & to give out a
large number of spray branches in all directions to keep control of the
wind and also to stop the wind from further to destroy the old trees in
its course the winds followed the well streams & then got the clear run
free of the trees until a run of heavy old tree trunks guided them out
again into the ground where the rising ground destroyed them by holding
them in face clear of the winds the night mist.\""
"3162" "Then I looked into her young eyes
From eighty years she looks back
Into my young eyes
And she is gone
To where?
Where has her soul gone?
Body found yes
But her very mark her sign
Lost it seems to me now
Though I feel that she is here still
All around me windsouled
To love is always to live somehow
As long as our eyes are still this colourdull glass
I will not know her still
This parched scorched earth
Endless wheel of suffering
Great ocean of pain
Bloodbucket of grief
Roaring mouthgaped O
Of disappointment and despair
Will not then exist
And we shall smile
We shall smile as big
As the big crescent moon
Which lies on its arched back and dreams
Of cats and stars and snow
And as before we saw smiley shining stars
And disreaching them
Our arms would wave like a desperate windmill
Hoping hoping to welcome them home
Now we shall touch them close to our hearts
And what we are
And what we may be
Maybe
Why I have failed
And all I could have been
And am not
And all I had hoped for
And were not
And everything I hoped
And hoped and hoped and hoped for
I prayed in the morning
And I prayed in the evening
And I got not
From the rotgut god
When all the world starts to shiver
And shimmer and shake all around me
And all the worldlight was piecemeal
And peaceless
This is the atomic pain of the worlds
The molecular tears
The final crystalline structure of misery
That winds its way around the wooden snakejawed growing spine
Of the worlds
Listen: I was taken
To be betrayed whenever is hate
To be betrayed wherever is hate
As the body is abused by man
There in the Patrapassion edge of the world
The hanging god is invaded
In heart and soul
I suffer you all suffer
You suffer all I suffer
Suffer suffer suffer suffer
The tearblowing world creaks around
And we are broken (Loss!)
Loss
Light and darkness
Light and darkness
It seems to the little blue and green world
That they do not know each other
But they must finally
(The Master says that Satan too shall be forgiven)
Forgiven
And suffering before
We suffer too
Here's sixpence
Here's sixpence
Go and play and play
In the flaky pale fields that still are somehow this land
And spend oh spend your life away
Spend your spend your night away
And waste and waste your life away
Under the brightstarlight
Under your yewboned archlight body
you are dead
Under this shitstained sky
you are dead
Under the loveless muddy almoststars
You are dead
Under the sleeping closed eyes of the Bhagavan
You are dead
Under the road and the track and the path
Along the green grass slipping way
Along the snaking way
you are deady deady
Deady deady
Deady deady
Dead

The lights are dead and so are you
The light is dead and so are you"

"3197" "Hello, it's been a long time since I have seen you here. With the look that's in your eyes, you've left behind your fear to step out on your own. Now the world will know who you were meant to be.
Come on and burn your bridges away, cause you know that we're not going back to where we have been. This road will show us there's a place where you and me can begin to say the things that we've been meaning to say. Now it's time to burn your bridges away.
Fading out with the daylight, the worry on your mind. Now the fight has turned to flight, but we'll make it out alive. So leave it all, let's go. Cause we'll risk everything we know to reach the other side.
We have just the lives we lead to show this world what we believe - find out now who you will be."
"3198" "Maybe right now, this is the best that you've found - to live a life that's tearing you down day by day. Maybe right now, you can't seem to find a way out and you're afraid to trust in the sound of your own voice, so listen...
Runaway, we're gonna write our perfect story - all the way until the end. Runaway, if you think something else is waiting, follow me until the end.
So where do you go when all of the places you know, they no longer feel like a home? When theres no painted road to lead you to where you should be, could you find the strength to believe? That more is waiting if you just leave this life behind, and choose today to...
Sometimes you just don't know, but there's a risk worth taking to find the life that's waiting. So don't be afraid to make a choice - let go. I'll be right here waiting for you. You were never alone."
"3199" "When I look at you How could you look at me? I'm thinking now all that you are Is much more than I'll ever be. It seems today, I'll never catch a break. I'm feeling like all that I am Is all the mistakes that I've made.
You're you far away Inside of memories, but when I listen you say
What do you have to fear when you're left all alone? In the darkest of days, when the night's growing cold, you're safe in the arms of a love all your own. In the darkest of your days, there's a love that you should know.
I remember when We were innocent, now they're telling us All that we are Is all of the places we've been. When the seconds slow And you're standing on your own, you'll start coming back Into the arms of love that you should've known.
When you're feeling lost and your hope is gone, your scars never seem to fade. But there is more to you - there is more to me.
The past doesn't change a thing."
"3200" "Here we are again - where all that I am is never enough to bring me the truth. So I turn to you to make me complete and justify me.
So I'll hold on to you, if you hold on to me.
Hold on to me when all that you see is falling apart right at the seams. When you're at the end of your rope, just hold on to me. Why can't you see I'm falling apart right at the seams? I'm hanging by a thread.
A heart and a soul are caught between bones - the emptiness it rings. When I am alone, somehow I know the words that you speak could never save me.
But I'll hold on to you, if you hold on to me.
When you hold on to me, why can't you see I'm falling apart right at the seams? I hold on to you like you hold on to me, but we're falling apart now."
"3201" "I thought you were the only one that I'd ever see. But you weren't the one to show me what it meant to believe.
I thought that we had found a home, but now I walk alone.
With you or without you, I have waited for so long. And now we must say goodbye for the last time. Cause we are two hearts, one world apart.
I thought we knew it better, but took the fruit from the vine. (Nothing can last forever, but we thought that we could try) We sealed our fate together when I put faith in your eyes. (Now what we had together breathes its last breath tonight)
I'll go on, but we have reached the end."

Ze moet nog naar 't station
Neem jij de wagen dan haalt ze het wel\"
Ik zei \"da's goed\" en reed zo stom als ik kon
We kwamen aan bij een leeg perron
En ik zei \"het zit je niet mee\"
Heel in de verte ging de laatste wagon
En Annabel zei \"okee, ik ga met je mee\"
En later lagen we samen, zoals dat heet
Een beetje moe maar voldaan
Er kwam al licht door de ramen ze zei
\"Geen tijd voor ontbijt ik moet gaan\"
Ik zei alleen nog \"tot ziens Annabel\"
En ik dacht \"Die zie ik nooit meer terug\"
Ik dacht ik draai me om en slaap nog even door
Maar twee uur later was ik nog wakker, lag stil op m'n rug
Annabel, het wordt niets zonder jou, Annabel
Annabel, het wordt niets zonder jou, Annabel
Zo bleef ik twee dagen liggen in bed
Ik was totaal van de kaart
Toen stond ik op ik moest niet denken maar doen
Want zonder haar was ik geen stuiver meer waard
Ik liep de stad door op zoek naar een glimp
En ik dacht \"ik zie haar nooit meer terug\"
Ik ging zelfs hardop praten in mezelf
En iemand zei \"je stond uren met je handen op de leuning van de brug\"
Ahah
Annabel, het wordt niets zonder jou, Annabel
Annabel, het wordt niets zonder jou, Annabel
Toen op een avond zag ik haar weer
Ze stapte net op de tram
Ze was nog mooier dan de vorige keer
Ik riep haar naam en trapte hard op m'n rem
Ik sprong de auto uit en greep haar vast
Ze stond stil en keek om
Ze keek me aan maar was nauwelijks verrast
En ik zei \"hee, waar moet je naartoe\" ze zei \"naar het station\"
Ik bracht haar weg ze kocht een kaartje Parijs
En ik zei \"en nog 1 erbij\"
De lokettist gaf tweemaal enkele reis
En Annabel keek even opzij
Ik zei \"ik heb je gevonden vandaag
En ik laat je nooit meer alleen
Al reis je door naar Barcelona of Praag
Al reis je door naar het eind van de wereld ik ga met je mee, hee\""

oh... what am I gonna do?
if you were a melody I'm quite sure you would be in a movie
where the characters look lovely and the plot is about romance
you would sound right there in the climax scene
where all the problems of those characters seem to disappear
oh... I wonder what are you doing now
oh... you wonder what I am doing now
oh... I wonder what I am doing now
oh... what am I gonna do?"
"3238" "I wish this air could clean my chest
I needed a quiet day
I take a walk outside my house
a freezy haze is freezing my head
And I still myself
I saw my hands into the ground
the rain is hard behind my door
the rain is covering my eyes
I wish it could clean my sight
And I still myself
So I still myself
Really needed a quiet day
really needed to hear my voice
I wish this air could clean my chest
I wish the rain could clean my sight"
"3239" "Where have all people gone?
Where is your skin when I'm in this bed lying
My shoes seem covered with snow
and I used your words to keep them dry
I'm miles away but I feel you here
I'm far away but closer than yesterday
Cotton is floating and I use it to build a castle
It's weak and fake and useless like
some of the stories I've told to my friends
And I'll play a song to keep you awake
And I'm weightless so I will let the wind take me where you are"
"3240" "Don't wanna know if I miss you
don't wanna know if you do
we both felt home once being alone
and now I see yours shoes soaked
I should've stay 'cause the world didn't matter
I should've stay 'cause the world didn't matter
And I pictured your eyes
and dwelled on your name
But you fell in love with a tree
you fell in love with a tree
Don't you dare say I didn't want to go and hold you
Don't you dare say I didn't want to go
covered with dust
lifted by the air
covered with dust
lifted by your breath
And I pictured your eyes
and dwelled on your name
But you fell in love with a tree
you fell in love with a tree
and I fell in love with a girl
but you never saw that I was in love with that girl in love with a tree"
"3241" "my head is silent
sensations change with every other person who passes me by
windy days remove the leaves that fall has left on empty streets and now they fly like birds
it's getting cold and Monday is blue but suddenly the sun has risen in this crowded lonely city I'm getting urges to
there's water on the sidewalk and some huge grey clouds perfectly mirror down my feet
my head down slowly change its posture and now I look straight at someone I recognize as a theft
leaves have fallen and stay as part of the ground
my movements seem slower 'cause fear dangerously approached
hey, what are the chances?
hey, how in the world I came to this?
must I get rid of this?
today this place is full of broken umbrellas
people are running fast to be under a roof
the air inside my lungs is clear, but you polluted the time and the quietude I was supposed to be in now"
